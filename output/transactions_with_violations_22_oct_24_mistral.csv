T004,16-10-24,13029.37,Vendor I,PO1635,Purchase,22.61%,,Yes,01-11-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (13,029.37 AED) exceeds the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage (22.61%) on this transaction is above the allowed threshold of 15%. However, there's no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field.

3. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount exceeds AED 5,000 and does not have authorization from the department head (Department_Authorization is 'No').

4. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 and there's no approval from the finance department (Prior_Finance_Approval is 'No')."

2. Purchase Authorization - The transaction amount is more than AED 5,000 and there is no authorization from the department head (Department_Authorization: No)."
T006,16-08-24,4592.59,Vendor F,PO1004,Purchase,21.08%,,Yes,14-09-24,Yes,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) and number 3 (Vendor Restrictions).

For Discounts, the invoice has a discount of 21.08%, which is above the allowed limit of 15%. However, there is no justification provided for this discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, as required by the policy.

For Vendor Restrictions, the transaction was made with vendor F (Vendor F is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor: Vendor A, C, E, G, I). Therefore, this purchase is not compliant with the policy."
T007,10-08-24,13299.9,Vendor C,PO1657,Invoice,0.43%,,Yes,25-08-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in point 1 of the Purchase Policy Document. The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Since there is no indication that Prior_Finance_Approval is 'Yes' for this transaction, it violates this policy."
T008,26-08-24,12023.32,Vendor E,PO1004,Purchase,20.45%,Special promotion applied,No,26-08-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates multiple policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (Prior_Finance_Approval is No).
2. Discounts: The discount percentage (20.45%) is more than 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the discount (Discount_Justification field is not empty).
3. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as the value for Tax Paid is 'No'."
T009,15-09-24,9162.44,Vendor F,PO1249,Purchase,12.31%,,Yes,27-10-24,No,Office Computers,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction violates the following policy constraints:

* Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 9162.44 which exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (Prior_Finance_Approval field is 'No').
* Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is AED 9162.44 which is above AED 5,000 and Department_Authorization field is 'No'.
* Vendor Restrictions: The transaction vendor (Vendor F) is not listed as a procurement approved vendor (not in the list of Vendor A, C, E, G, I).

Therefore, the answer is 'Yes' - this transaction violates multiple policy constraints."
T010,13-09-24,11486.03,Vendor E,PO1407,Invoice,13.52%,,No,16-10-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 7 (Purchase Authorization) and number 5 (Discounts). The transaction amount of AED 11486.03 is above AED 5000, but there is no Department_Authorization in the data fields. Also, the discount percentage (13.52%) is more than 15% and does not have a justification mentioned in Discount_Justification field. Therefore, this transaction violates the Purchase Authorization policy and Discounts policy."

3. Discounts: The discount on this invoice is more than 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the discount in the transaction data.
4. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as stated in the policy.

Therefore, the transaction violates policies regarding maximum purchase limit, vendor restrictions, discounts, and tax compliance. It should be flagged for review."

T015,07-07-24,9007.49,Vendor H,PO1004,Invoice,19.00%,Special promotion applied,Yes,02-08-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Based on the provided policy, the transaction T015 appears to violate two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor ""Vendor H"" is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor (Vendor A, C, E, G, I).
2. Discounts: The discount on this transaction (19%) exceeds the 15% threshold without a justification provided in the Discount_Justification field.

Therefore, the answer is 'Yes', the transaction violates policy constraints."

T017,04-09-24,7404.73,Vendor D,PO1729,Invoice,23.50%,Special promotion applied,No,01-10-24,No,Laptops,Yes," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Discounts section of the policy. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the transaction's discount (23.50%) exceeds the 15% threshold, but there is no mentioned justification for the discount in the transaction data. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes', the transaction violates policy constraint 5."
T018,17-09-24,9775.75,Vendor F,PO1180,Invoice,15.01%,Special promotion applied,No,24-09-24,No,Consulting Services,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint 5 (Discounts) because the discount given on this invoice is 15.01%, which exceeds the maximum allowed discount of 15%. Additionally, since there is no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, it does not comply with the policy requirement to include a justification for any discount above the specified percentage."

T020,31-07-24,4453.95,Vendor F,PO1148,Purchase,16.78%,Special promotion applied,No,09-08-24,No,Office Computers,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions) and number 5 (Discounts). The vendor ""Vendor F"" is not listed as a procurement approved vendor, which violates the policy regarding who can be purchased from. Additionally, the discount percentage of 16.78% exceeds the allowed 15%, and there is no justification provided for this discount in the transaction data, which also violates the policy regarding discounts."
T021,22-07-24,18880.77,Vendor F,PO1688,Invoice,20.46%,,Yes,28-07-24,No,Printer Supplies,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 18,880.77) exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. According to the policy, purchases cannot exceed this limit unless approved beforehand.

2. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (AED 18,880.77) is above AED 5,000 and does not have authorization from the department head as indicated by Department_Authorization field being 'No'. According to the policy, purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head.

The other fields do not seem to violate any specific policy constraints directly, but they could still be flagged for review based on the policies mentioned:

- Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor F) is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I).
- Multiple Purchases: Although it's a single transaction, the policy also applies to multiple purchases within a 7-day period. If there have been other transactions from Vendor F for the same item within the last 7 days, they could exceed the total limit of AED 20,000.
- Discounts: The discount percentage (20.46%) is above the 15% threshold without a justification provided in the Discount_Justification field.
- Tax Compliance: Although tax was paid as indicated by 'Yes' in the Tax Paid field, missing tax details could potentially lead to a flagging of the transaction if it were reviewed more closely."
T022,06-10-24,8211.6,Vendor I,PO1780,Purchase,22.72%,,No,31-10-24,No,Server Maintenance,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to Discounts (Policy 5). In this transaction, the discount percentage (22.72%) is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided in the 'Discount_Justification' field. As per the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since this transaction does not meet that requirement, it violates the policy."
T023,17-09-24,9365.67,Vendor A,PO1004,Purchase,13.55%,,Yes,11-10-24,No,Office Computers,Yes," Based on the provided policy document and transaction data, let's evaluate whether this transaction violates any policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit (single transaction) - The transaction amount is AED 9365.67, which is less than AED 10,000, so it does not violate this constraint.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline - The submitted date for the invoice is 11-10-24 (assuming MM-DD-YYYY format), which is more than 30 days after the transaction date (17-09-24). Therefore, this transaction violates the Invoice Submission Deadline constraint.
3. Vendor Restrictions - The vendor for this transaction is Vendor A, which is a procurement-approved vendor. So, it does not violate this constraint.
4. Multiple Purchases - This transaction does not involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so it does not violate this constraint.
5. Discounts - The discount percentage for this transaction is 13.55%, which is above the 15% threshold stated in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for this discount in the transaction data (Discount_Justification field is empty). As a result, it violates the Discounts constraint.
6. Tax Compliance - The transaction includes tax payments (Tax Paid: Yes), so it complies with this constraint.
7. Purchase Authorization - The Department Authorization for this transaction is No, and the amount is less than AED 5000. So, it does not violate this constraint.
8. Duplicate Invoices - There is no information suggesting that this is a duplicate invoice, so it does not appear to violate this constraint.

In summary, this transaction violates the Invoice Submission Deadline and Discounts constraints because of late invoice submission and lack of justification for the discount, respectively."

T025,07-09-24,4334.79,Vendor C,PO1929,Purchase,19.09%,Special promotion applied,No,09-10-24,No,Laptops,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to Policy Number 5: Discounts. The discount provided on this transaction (19.09%) is above the allowed threshold of 15% of the original price. However, there is also a justification provided for the discount (""Special promotion applied""), which suggests that internal approval was obtained for this exception. Therefore, it's important to review the justification and confirm if the internal approval followed proper procedures before taking any further action."
T026,11-07-24,6857.2,Vendor C,PO1675,Invoice,20.53%,,Yes,30-07-24,Yes,Security System Installation,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate one policy constraint. The violation is related to the discount percentage specified in the Purchase Policy Document (Policy 5). The invoice with a discount of 20.53% exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. However, since there is no justification provided for the discount (Discount_Justification field is empty), it does not comply with the policy requirement that invoices with discounts above 15% must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. It's important to note that this transaction also has other compliant attributes, such as being submitted within the deadline (Policy 2), having prior finance approval for exceeding the purchase limit (Policy 1), and the vendor is pre-approved (Policy 3)."
T027,20-09-24,12234.53,Vendor G,PO1276,Purchase,18.44%,Special promotion applied,No,16-10-24,No,Laptops,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints.

Firstly, the discount given (18.44%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% as per the ""Discounts"" section of the Purchase Policy Document (Policy point 5). Since the Discount percentage in this transaction is 18.44%, which is above the allowed 15%, it requires a justification from the vendor and internal approval, but there is no such justification provided in the transaction data.

Secondly, although prior finance department approval has been obtained for this transaction as mentioned (Prior_Finance_Approval: Yes), the amount of the transaction (AED 12,234.53) exceeds AED 10,000 which is the maximum purchase limit without prior approval (Policy point 1). Therefore, it should not have been approved without seeking higher-level approval from the finance department as per the policy guidelines."

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of 12787.73 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date for this transaction is 30 days after the purchase date, which violates the policy that invoices must be submitted within 30 days of the purchase date.

3. Discounts: The discount percentage on this transaction (21.14%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% without a justification provided in the 'Discount_Justification' field."
T030,03-10-24,10575.05,Vendor E,PO1198,Invoice,22.68%,,Yes,17-10-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints as follows:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount of the transaction (AED 10575.05) exceeds the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (AED 10,000).
2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The field 'Prior_Finance_Approval' indicates that no prior finance approval was given for this transaction, but it should have been, as per policy, since the amount exceeds AED 10,000."

The transaction amount of AED 14,404.85 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, the field 'Prior_Finance_Approval' indicates that no prior finance approval was given, which is required when the amount is more than AED 10,000."
T033,13-07-24,14129.45,Vendor B,PO1387,Purchase,14.05%,,No,17-07-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The policy states in point 1 that ""Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department."" In this case, the transaction amount is AED 14,129.45 which is greater than AED 10,000 and does not have Prior_Finance_Approval. Therefore, it violates the Maximum Purchase Limit policy."
T034,10-10-24,14666.59,Vendor E,PO1004,Purchase,12.28%,,Yes,09-11-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The transaction exceeds the maximum purchase limit without prior approval from the finance department as stated in point 1 of the Purchase Policy Document. The transaction amount is AED 14,666.59 which is greater than AED 10,000 and does not have Prior_Finance_Approval marked as 'Yes'."
T035,27-08-24,10667.5,Vendor H,PO1648,Purchase,18.38%,Special promotion applied,No,20-09-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of 10667.5 AED exceeds the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department (Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval).

2. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor ""Vendor H"" is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (Procurement Approved Vendors: • Vendor A • Vendor C • Vendor E • Vendor G • Vendor I). Purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department.

3. Discounts: The discount of 18.38% exceeds the limit of 15% without a justification from the vendor and internal approval (Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval). Although there is a justification provided, it was not approved prior to the purchase."
T036,07-09-24,7361.61,Vendor E,PO1694,Purchase,9.25%,,No,06-10-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. The violation is in relation to the Maximum Purchase Limit (Point 1) as the transaction amount of AED 7361.61 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, there is no prior_Finance_Approval in this case. Even though the transaction amount does not exceed AED 5,000 (the requirement for Department Authorization), it still violates the maximum purchase limit rule due to lack of prior finance department approval."

The discount (22.33%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% without a justification provided. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval, which is missing in this case."
T040,09-09-24,13315.34,Vendor F,PO1510,Invoice,20.06%,Special promotion applied,Yes,22-09-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to the Maximum Purchase Limit (Policy 1) as the purchase amount exceeds AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Although the transaction has prior Finance Department Approval (Prior_Finance_Approval field: Yes), it should have been pre-approved by the finance department due to the amount being over AED 10,000."

The discount given in this transaction is 19.91%, which exceeds the permitted maximum of 15%. Additionally, even though prior finance approval was given (Prior_Finance_Approval: Yes), it should be noted that the purchase amount (7492.68 AED) did not require such approval according to policy constraint number 1 - Maximum Purchase Limit as the transaction amount is less than 10,000 AED. However, since the discount exceeds the allowed limit of 15%, the transaction violates the policy."
T044,31-08-24,10288.04,Vendor E,PO1301,Invoice,2.69%,,No,15-09-24,No,Office Computers,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is regarding the Maximum Purchase Limit as stated in section 1 of the Purchase Policy Document. The transaction amount (AED 10288.04) exceeds the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department, which should be AED 10,000 according to the policy. Although there is a Prior_Finance_Approval field indicating 'Yes', this approval might have been made with the intention of approving an amount over AED 10,000, which violates the policy."
T045,14-08-24,12654.53,Vendor A,PO1004,Purchase,5.16%,,Yes,16-08-24,No,IT Equipment,Yes," The transaction T045 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints explicitly mentioned in the provided policy document. Here is a brief explanation for each check:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount (AED 12,654.53) is below AED 10,000, so it doesn't require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date for this transaction is within 30 days of the purchase date (August 24th to August 16th), so it's valid according to the policy.
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor A is a procurement-approved vendor, which satisfies the policy constraint.
4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction doesn't involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so this condition is not applicable here.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (5.16%) is below the threshold of 15%, and there is no justification required for this discount.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Yes"" under Tax Paid.
7. Purchase Authorization: Since the amount is less than AED 5,000, it doesn't require authorization from the department head.
8. Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices are mentioned for this transaction, so it seems to comply with the policy constraint as well."
T046,12-08-24,5898.01,Vendor C,PO1004,Purchase,12.84%,,No,19-08-24,Yes,IT Equipment,Yes," The transaction T046 does not violate any of the specified policy constraints. Here's an explanation for each constraint to justify the answer:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount is AED 5898.01, which is less than AED 10,000.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (the difference between the ""Submitted Date"" and ""Date"" is 7 days, which is less than 30 days).
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor is pre-approved by the procurement department (Vendor C is in the list of Procurement Approved Vendors).
4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about previous transactions within a 7-day period, so it cannot be determined if this constraint is violated.
5. Discounts: The discount is 12.84%, which is below the 15% threshold specified in the policy. No justification for the discount is provided, but as long as the discount is within the limit, it doesn't violate the policy.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction specifies that tax was not paid (Tax Paid: No), and this is allowed since the vendor is not tax-exempt.
7. Purchase Authorization: The department head authorization is provided as ""Yes"" for this transaction, which satisfies the requirement for purchases above AED 5,000.
8. Duplicate Invoices: Since there's no information about duplicate invoices for the same purchase order, it cannot be determined if this constraint is violated.

In summary, all policy constraints are satisfied in this transaction, so the answer is 'No'."
T047,09-10-24,16871.02,Vendor D,PO1420,Purchase,23.98%,Special promotion applied,No,05-11-24,No,Server Maintenance,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount of the transaction (AED 16871.02) exceeds the single transaction limit without prior approval from the finance department (AED 10,000). Although there is a Prior_Finance_Approval field with 'Yes', it should be noted that the policy states that purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000, not just require prior approval.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage for this transaction (23.98%) is above the threshold of 15% specified in the policy. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, there is no such justification provided in the given transaction details.

These two violations are sufficient to classify the transaction as non-compliant according to the stated policy. It's important to ensure compliance with purchasing policies to maintain financial integrity and avoid unnecessary risks or issues."

1. Vendor Restrictions (Policy 3): The vendor, ""Vendor H"", is not on the list of procurement approved vendors which includes only ""Vendor A"", ""Vendor C"", ""Vendor E"", ""Vendor G"", and ""Vendor I"". Therefore, this transaction violates the policy.

2. Tax Compliance (Policy 6): The transaction indicates that no tax was paid, but according to the policy, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Since no information about the vendor's tax status is provided in this case, it could be interpreted as a violation of the policy, although more information would be needed to confirm this definitively."
T049,03-08-24,12605.33,Vendor E,PO1004,Purchase,11.60%,,Yes,06-08-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) because the purchase amount of AED 12,605.33 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it doesn't comply with constraint number 7 (Purchase Authorization) since the department head authorization is ""Yes"", but the purchase amount is more than AED 5,000 and there is no justification for this in the provided data. Finally, it does not violate any other policy constraints based on the given information."
T050,16-09-24,3842.17,Vendor G,PO1800,Invoice,21.29%,,Yes,29-09-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction appears to violate two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount on this invoice (21.29%) exceeds the 15% limit specified in the Purchase Policy Document without providing a justification for it. As per policy point 5, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval, which is missing in this case.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date of the invoice (29-09-24) is more than 30 days after the transaction date (16-09-24). According to policy point 2, invoices must be submitted within 30 days of the purchase date. Any invoices submitted later than 30 days will be flagged for review, which this invoice falls under since it was submitted more than 30 days after the transaction occurred."
T051,04-10-24,8172.27,Vendor D,PO1437,Invoice,19.48%,Special promotion applied,Yes,25-10-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Based on the provided policy, the transaction T051 does violate two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage on this invoice is 19.48%, which is above the allowed 15% stated in policy point 5. Therefore, a justification from the vendor and internal approval should have been included according to the policy.

2. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor associated with transaction T051, Vendor D, is not listed among the Procurement Approved Vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). According to policy point 3, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department.

So, the answer is 'Yes', the transaction T051 violates policy constraints."
T052,01-09-24,5285.43,Vendor A,PO1079,Purchase,17.70%,Special promotion applied,Yes,04-10-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is with respect to the Discounts policy (point 5). In this case, the discount percentage on the invoice (17.70%) is above the 15% threshold specified in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for this discount in the transaction data fields. According to the policy, all invoices with discounts above 15% must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since there is no justification provided here, the transaction violates this policy."
T053,05-07-24,2345.88,Vendor E,PO1094,Purchase,2.88%,,Yes,09-08-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction details, the transaction T053 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are some reasons why:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 2345.88 is less than AED 10,000, so no prior approval from the finance department is required.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: Although the submitted date (09-08-24) is later than the purchase date (05-07-24), it is still within the 30 days grace period for invoice submission.

3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor E is a pre-approved vendor, so purchases from this vendor are allowed.

4. Multiple Purchases: There's no mention of multiple purchases in this case, as there is only one transaction.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (2.88%) is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification is required.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".

7. Purchase Authorization: Since the amount is below AED 5,000, department head authorization is not necessary.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no evidence of duplicate invoices in this transaction.

Therefore, the answer is 'No', the transaction does not violate any policy constraints as stated."
T054,20-09-24,14069.62,Vendor C,PO1280,Invoice,6.79%,,Yes,12-10-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (""Maximum Purchase Limit""). The amount of the transaction (AED 14069.62) exceeds the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department, which is AED 10,000 according to the policy document. Additionally, since no prior finance approval was provided, it violates constraint number 7 (""Purchase Authorization"")."
T055,06-07-24,8061.06,Vendor C,PO1105,Invoice,10.67%,,No,27-07-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the ""Discounts"" policy (point 5). In this case, the discount percentage (10.67%) is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since this transaction lacks that justification, it violates the stated policy."
T056,24-09-24,8550.74,Vendor A,PO1999,Purchase,21.98%,Special promotion applied,Yes,25-10-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5, ""Discounts"". The discount provided by Vendor A (21.98%) is above 15% of the original price. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, in this case, the transaction file does not show any justification for the large discount provided. Therefore, it violates the policy."
T057,04-10-24,4165.16,Vendor I,PO1196,Purchase,20.44%,Special promotion applied,Yes,20-10-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the specific reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount (20.44%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% without a justification from the vendor and internal approval. According to the policy, any invoices with discounts above 15% must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

2. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount (4165.16 AED) does not exceed the limit for which prior finance department approval is required (AED 10,000), but it should still have prior finance approval because the discount exceeds the allowed limit without justification.

To be compliant with this transaction, either the vendor needs to provide a justification for the high discount or internal approval should have been obtained before the purchase."
T058,15-07-24,7268.87,Vendor E,PO1901,Purchase,4.86%,,Yes,22-07-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T058 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints in this case. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 7268.87, which is below the set limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: Although the submission date (22-07-24) is later than 30 days from the purchase date (15-07-24), it still falls within the grace period, so it won't be flagged for review.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction vendor, Vendor E, is in the list of pre-approved vendors, which complies with the policy.

4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about multiple purchases within a 7-day period or a total amount exceeding AED 20,000 for this transaction, so it doesn't violate this constraint.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage provided in the transaction is less than 15%, so an additional justification is not required.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment (Tax Paid: Yes), so it complies with the policy.

7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is below AED 5,000, and there's no requirement for department head authorization in this case.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about receiving multiple invoices for the same purchase order, so it doesn't violate this constraint."
T059,22-08-24,4230.4,Vendor A,PO1829,Purchase,9.66%,,No,24-08-24,No,Security System Installation,No,No violation
T060,29-07-24,14678.06,Vendor F,PO1699,Purchase,20.24%,Special promotion applied,No,24-08-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of 14678.06 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date of the transaction (24-08-24) is more than 30 days after the purchase date (29-07-24), which violates the invoice submission deadline policy.

3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor F is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I).

4. Discounts: The discount of 20.24% exceeds the threshold of 15% without a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

5. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: No"". This violates the policy that all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt."
T061,28-09-24,12470.3,Vendor B,PO1762,Invoice,16.75%,Special promotion applied,Yes,02-10-24,No,Printer Supplies,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is 12470.3 AED which exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (as stated in policy point 1). However, the field 'Prior_Finance_Approval' shows that it has been approved, but this doesn't absolve the fact that the amount is higher than the specified limit.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage on the transaction invoice (16.75%) is above the 15% threshold set by the policy in point 5. Since there is no justification for this high discount provided in the 'Discount_Justification' field, it violates the policy.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor B, is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor (as stated in policy point 3). This also means that the transaction violates the policy."
T062,21-08-24,7106.6,Vendor E,PO1665,Purchase,23.15%,Special promotion applied,No,03-09-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints for the following reasons:

1) Discounts: The invoice has a discount of 23.15%, which exceeds the allowed 15% limit as stated in the Purchase Policy (point 5). Therefore, it requires justification from the vendor and internal approval, but no such justification is mentioned in the transaction data.

2) Tax Compliance: The transaction states that tax was not paid (Tax Paid: No), whereas according to the policy, all purchases should include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt (point 6). Since we don't have information about the vendor's tax status, it can be assumed that this transaction violates the tax compliance policy.

3) Prior Finance Approval: Although the department authorization (Yes) and purchase order are present, prior finance approval is required for transactions exceeding AED 10,000. In this case, the amount (7106.6) does not surpass the limit but there is no mention of 'No' in the Prior_Finance_Approval field, which suggests that the policy constraint has not been met.

Overall, the transaction violates the policies concerning discounts and tax compliance, and may have violated the prior finance approval requirement as well (assuming that the amount exceeded AED 10,000 with the missing 'No' in the Prior_Finance_Approval field). It would be best to investigate this transaction further and seek clarification from the relevant parties involved."
T063,25-08-24,13153.01,Vendor A,PO1110,Invoice,2.16%,,No,02-09-24,Yes,Laptops,Yes," The transaction T063 does not violate any policy constraints as mentioned in the provided Purchase Policy Document. Here are the reasons for each of the policies that apply to this transaction:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 13,153.01) is less than AED 10,000 for a single transaction, so it does not require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission date (02-09-24) is within 30 days of the purchase date (25-08-24), which means it complies with this policy.
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor A is a procurement approved vendor, as stated in the Procurement Approved Vendors list.
4. Multiple Purchases: Since this is an individual transaction and there are no other transactions within a 7-day period for the same item (laptops), it complies with this policy.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage provided in this transaction (2.16%) is less than the 15% threshold, so a justification from the vendor and internal approval is not required.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as stated, but since the vendor is not tax-exempt, it might be flagged for review if tax details are missing in the overall picture. However, without more context or information about other transactions, it's difficult to say for sure.
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (AED 13,153.01) is greater than AED 5,000 and the Department_Authorization field shows ""Yes,"" which means the department head has authorized this purchase.
8. Duplicate Invoices: This policy cannot be verified with the given information since we don't have information about other invoices for the same PO1110. However, the fact that there is no duplicate invoice listed in this transaction supports compliance with this policy."
T064,17-09-24,8915.57,Vendor D,PO1528,Purchase,1.54%,,Yes,20-09-24,No,Server Maintenance,Yes," Based on the given policy and transaction details, the transaction T064 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints outright. Here's a brief breakdown:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount (8915.57 AED) is below the limit for a single transaction without prior approval (10,000 AED).
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (20-09-24 within 30 days from 17-09-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor D is not listed as a procurement approved vendor, but since this transaction is a purchase, it may not be applicable in this case.
4. Multiple Purchases: Since there's no information about previous transactions for the same item within 7 days, we cannot verify if this constraint is violated or not.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (1.54%) is below the threshold of 15%. No justification is needed in this case.
6. Tax Compliance: The tax was paid (Yes).
7. Purchase Authorization: The amount is less than AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: Since there's no mention of any duplicate invoices for the same purchase order, we cannot verify if this constraint is violated or not.

However, it should be noted that Vendor D is not in the list of procurement approved vendors. If such a restriction applies to purchases as well, then this transaction would indeed violate policy constraint number 3."
T065,15-07-24,5959.23,Vendor F,PO1409,Purchase,21.57%,,Yes,31-07-24,No,Office Computers,Yes," Yes, the transaction appears to violate two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor F) is not included in the list of procurement approved vendors (Procurement Approved Vendors: • Vendor A • Vendor C • Vendor E • Vendor G • Vendor I). As per policy, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage on this transaction (21.57%) is above the 15% limit stated in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for the discount, which is required as per policy. Therefore, even though the discount amount might be within the limit when justified, it still violates the policy because the justification is missing."
T066,03-07-24,6017.36,Vendor B,PO1109,Invoice,3.66%,,No,16-07-24,Yes,Office Computers,Yes,No violation
T067,04-08-24,9679.15,Vendor E,PO1268,Invoice,15.20%,Special promotion applied,Yes,14-08-24,No,Security System Installation,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. It violates the ""Discounts"" policy (point 5 in the Purchase Policy Document). The discount percentage on this invoice is 15.20%, which exceeds the permitted 15% discount. However, it seems that there is a justification provided for the discount (""Special promotion applied""), so further investigation or clarification might be needed to determine if the justification is sufficient according to internal approval processes. It's also worth noting that prior finance approval was given as indicated in ""Prior_Finance_Approval: Yes"" field, which is compliant with policy point 7 (Purchase Authorization)."
T068,10-09-24,4006.17,Vendor I,PO1812,Purchase,19.46%,Special promotion applied,Yes,19-09-24,No,Server Maintenance,Yes," Based on the provided policy document and transaction data, the transaction T068 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints, but it is close to two different policy limits:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 4,006.17 which falls below the specified maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval. However, the transaction does have Prior_Finance_Approval set to 'Yes'.

2. Discounts: The discount applied is 19.46% which exceeds the stated policy limit of 15%. However, there is also a justification for the discount (Special promotion applied) provided in the Discount_Justification field, making this transaction compliant with the stated policy.

3. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is below AED 5,000, so it does not require authorization from the department head. Therefore, it is compliant with the stated policy regarding purchase authorization.

4. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction was made from a pre-approved vendor (Vendor I) which is compliant with the stated policy for vendor restrictions.

5. Multiple Purchases: Since there is no information provided about previous transactions within the last 7 days, it is not possible to determine if this transaction violates the multiple purchases policy constraint.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment details and the tax was paid, making it compliant with the stated policy for tax compliance.

7. Duplicate Invoices: Since there is no information about duplicate invoices related to this transaction, it is not possible to determine if this transaction violates the stated policy regarding duplicate invoices.

In summary, while the transaction T068 exceeds the stated discount limit and may approach the multiple purchases limit without sufficient information, it does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints based on the provided data. It is essential to keep tracking past transactions within the last 7 days for monitoring compliance with the multiple purchases policy constraint."
T069,21-09-24,5982.61,Vendor E,PO1240,Purchase,14.45%,,No,19-10-24,No,Server Maintenance,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint 5 - Discounts. The transaction has a discount of 14.45%, which is above the 15% threshold specified in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for this discount in the Discount_Justification field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the transaction does not meet this requirement."
T070,14-08-24,13143.13,Vendor C,PO1663,Invoice,12.57%,,Yes,14-08-24,Yes,Laptops,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts). The transaction has a discount of 12.57%, which is above 15% of the original price. However, there is no justification provided for this discount in the Discount_Justification field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, since there is no justification provided, it violates the policy."
T071,09-08-24,12356.24,Vendor I,PO1572,Invoice,5.69%,,Yes,07-09-24,No,Consulting Services,Yes," Based on the provided policy, the transaction T071 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 12,356.24 which is less than AED 10,000, so it doesn't require prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice for this transaction was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (07-09-24, which is within 30 days of 09-08-24).

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor I, is listed as one of the procurement approved vendors.

4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about other transactions within a 7-day period to compare this transaction with. However, even if there were multiple purchases from the same vendor in a 7-day period, it would still be less than AED 20,000 for this particular transaction.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage is within the allowed limit (15% or less).

6. Tax Compliance: The tax was paid as indicated by 'Yes'.

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount of the transaction is less than AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no indication that this is a duplicate invoice.

However, it is worth noting that there is no justification for the discount provided in the transaction data. According to policy 5, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Although this transaction doesn't violate any policies, it does not fully comply with the stated policy regarding discounts."
T072,20-08-24,10645.49,Vendor B,PO1224,Purchase,12.81%,,Yes,08-09-24,No,Printer Supplies,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The transaction amount of AED 10645.49 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department as stated in policy point 1. Additionally, the 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field indicates that finance department approval was received, but this is not necessary if the amount is below AED 10,000. Since the transaction amount is above the limit and prior approval was received, it violates the policy."
T073,29-09-24,13650.42,Vendor I,PO1798,Purchase,10.22%,,No,07-10-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 13,650.42 which exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (as per Policy 1).

2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction does not have prior approval from the finance department even though the amount exceeds AED 10,000 (as per Policy 1 and Transaction data: Prior_Finance_Approval field is 'No').

3. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is above AED 5,000 but it does not have authorization from the department head as per Policy 7 (Transaction data: Department_Authorization field is 'Yes', but this indicates approval for an amount greater than AED 5,000 when the actual amount exceeds AED 10,000)."
T074,26-07-24,2604.97,Vendor B,PO1035,Purchase,8.49%,,Yes,11-08-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction (T074) does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount is AED 2604.97, which is below AED 10,000, so prior approval from the finance department is not required.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission deadline was not specified for this transaction as it's a purchase record, not an invoice.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor B) is not listed among the procurement-approved vendors. However, the policy does not specify penalties or violations for purchases from unapproved vendors in this context.

4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about previous transactions with the same vendor within a 7-day period to compare against the AED 20,000 limit.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage is 8.49%, which is below the threshold of 15% that requires justification.

6. Tax Compliance: The tax was paid (Yes), as indicated in the transaction data.

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount is less than AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about any duplicate invoices for this purchase order (PO1035).

However, it's worth noting that Vendor B is not a procurement-approved vendor, which may be a potential issue depending on the company's internal policies and procedures. It would be advisable to investigate this further and ensure that there are no unauthorized or unapproved purchases taking place."
T075,24-09-24,6480.49,Vendor F,PO1231,Invoice,1.42%,,No,13-10-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions (3): The vendor, Vendor F, is not in the list of procurement-approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). As per the policy, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department.

2. Tax Compliance (6): The transaction does not include tax payments as indicated by 'No' for the field ""Tax Paid"". According to the policy, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Transactions missing tax details will be flagged.

In summary, this transaction violates the Vendor Restrictions and Tax Compliance policies."
T076,13-10-24,10954.84,Vendor A,PO1097,Invoice,10.95%,,Yes,05-11-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 10954.84 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department as stated in point 1 of the policy.
2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The field 'Prior_Finance_Approval' indicates that there is no prior finance department approval for this transaction, which contradicts the requirement in point 1 of the policy for transactions exceeding AED 10,000."
T077,25-09-24,5732.26,Vendor E,PO1617,Purchase,22.12%,Special promotion applied,No,26-10-24,Yes,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage (22.12%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, in this case, there is no evidence of such justification provided.

2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction amount (5732.26) exceeds AED 10,000, which requires prior finance department approval. In this transaction, the Prior_Finance_Approval field indicates 'No', but according to the policy, purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department."
T078,31-08-24,3066.4,Vendor G,PO1517,Invoice,0.16%,,Yes,16-09-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T078 does not appear to violate any of the explicitly stated policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 3066.4) is below AED 10,000, which is the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date, as it was submitted on 16-09-24 and the purchase date was on 31-08-24 (within the 30 days).
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor G is a procurement-approved vendor (as it's listed in the Procurement Approved Vendors list).
4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction does not involve multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period, so this constraint is not applicable.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (16%) is below 15% of the original price, which means it doesn't require justification or internal approval.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (AED 3066.4) is below AED 5,000, which is the threshold for department head authorization.
8. Duplicate Invoices: No information suggests that this invoice is a duplicate of another invoice for the same purchase order."

T080,05-08-24,9334.17,Vendor I,PO1361,Purchase,4.07%,,Yes,31-08-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction does not appear to violate any policy constraints. Here's a breakdown of how it complies with each policy point:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 9334.17 which is below the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000, so no prior approval from finance is required.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission deadline has not been specified for a purchase, but the submitted date (31-08-24) falls within 30 days of the transaction date (05-08-24), so it complies with this policy.
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor I is listed as a procurement approved vendor.
4. Multiple Purchases: The policy doesn't specify whether laptops are included in this rule, but even if they were, this transaction would not exceed the limit of AED 20,000 for multiple purchases within a 7-day period.
5. Discounts: The discount is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification is required.
6. Tax Compliance: The tax was paid as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is below AED 5,000, so authorization from the department head is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: No information is provided about whether this is a duplicate invoice or not. However, based on the data provided, it does not appear to be a duplicate.

In conclusion, the transaction T080 does not violate any of the policy constraints as described in the Purchase Policy Document."
T081,24-07-24,14952.9,Vendor C,PO1212,Purchase,16.47%,Special promotion applied,No,05-08-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the specific violations:

1. Purchase Limit: The purchase amount (AED 14,952.9) exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage (16.47%) is above the permitted limit of 15% without a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, there is no such justification provided in the transaction data."
T082,22-09-24,8024.54,Vendor E,PO1092,Invoice,0.29%,,Yes,18-10-24,Yes,Projector,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T082 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints directly. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit (policy 1): The transaction amount is below AED 10,000, so it doesn't require prior approval from the finance department. However, if there were any other transactions within the last seven days with the same vendor that exceeded AED 20,000 in total, this could potentially violate policy 4 (Multiple Purchases).

2. Vendor Restrictions (policy 3): The transaction is made from a pre-approved vendor (Vendor E), so it complies with the policy.

3. Discounts (policy 5): The discount percentage is below 15%, so no justification is needed. However, since there's no entry for 'Discount_Justification', it would be flagged if we strictly follow the policy.

4. Purchase Authorization (policy 7): The transaction amount is above AED 5,000 and Department_Authorization is 'Yes', so it complies with the policy.

5. Duplicate Invoices (policy 8): There's no information about a previous invoice for the same purchase order, so we cannot confirm whether this policy is being violated or not.

In summary, while the transaction doesn't directly violate any specific policy constraint, it might violate the 'Multiple Purchases' and 'Duplicate Invoices' policies depending on other transactions and invoices. To be certain, a more comprehensive review considering all related data would be necessary."
T083,05-08-24,7241.23,Vendor I,PO1940,Purchase,12.06%,,No,13-08-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. The policy states that purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (Policy 1). In this case, the transaction amount is AED 7241.23 which is below AED 10,000, but there is no record of prior Finance department approval (Prior_Finance_Approval field shows 'No'). Since the transaction is not within the specified limit but lacks the required approval, it violates the policy."
T084,20-09-24,5728.68,Vendor I,PO1661,Purchase,16.56%,Special promotion applied,Yes,06-10-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 - Discounts. The invoice has a discount of 16.56%, which is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for this discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to the policy, all invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval."
T085,29-07-24,11974.58,Vendor F,PO1023,Invoice,13.00%,,Yes,16-08-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. It violates Rule 1: Maximum Purchase Limit, as the amount of AED 11,974.58 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it appears there is no record of Prior_Finance_Approval in this transaction."
T086,10-09-24,10210.16,Vendor E,PO1404,Invoice,0.55%,,No,07-10-24,No,Office Computers,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints as described in the Purchase Policy Document. The violation is related to Maximum Purchase Limit (Clause 1) and Purchase Authorization (Clause 7).

1. Maximum Purchase Limit : The amount of AED 10210.16 for this transaction exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.
2. Purchase Authorization : Since the amount of the transaction is more than AED 5,000 (AED 10,210.16 > AED 5,000), it requires authorization from the department head, but Department_Authorization field shows 'No'.

In summary, this transaction violates the Purchase Policy because it exceeds the single transaction limit without prior approval and lacks proper authorization."
T087,13-07-24,10291.79,Vendor A,PO1810,Invoice,16.92%,Special promotion applied,Yes,21-07-24,No,Conference Room Setup,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 - Discounts. The invoice has a discount of 16.92%, which is above the 15% threshold specified in the policy. However, it also has a justification (""Special promotion applied"") as required by the policy. Therefore, it's important to note that this transaction might still need internal approval due to the high percentage discount. But, the justification from the vendor satisfies the requirement mentioned in point 5 of the policy. The other policies seem to be compliant with this transaction, given the provided information."
T088,24-07-24,10126.67,Vendor B,PO1468,Purchase,1.96%,,Yes,26-07-24,No,Software Subscription,Yes," Based on the provided policy and transaction details, the transaction T088 does violate a policy constraint.

The violation is with regard to the Maximum Purchase Limit rule (1). The transaction amount of 10126.67 exceeds AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Although Prior_Finance_Approval field value shows 'Yes', it contradicts the transaction amount which is greater than AED 10,000."
T089,14-09-24,11367.94,Vendor I,PO1899,Purchase,13.99%,,Yes,17-10-24,Yes,Consulting Services,Yes," Yes, the transaction appears to violate two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 11,367.94 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Although there is a 'Yes' for Department_Authorization, this field only refers to authorization from the department head, not the finance department.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage on this invoice (13.99%) is above the 15% limit specified in the policy. However, since there is no justification provided for the discount ('Discount_Justification' field is empty), it is not compliant with the policy.

It's essential to ensure that all transactions comply with the purchasing policies to maintain financial control and accountability within the organization."
T090,11-07-24,10116.69,Vendor F,PO1518,Purchase,3.12%,,Yes,16-07-24,No,Conference Room Setup,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. Specifically, it violates the Maximum Purchase Limit policy because the amount (10116.69 AED) exceeds the maximum limit for a single transaction without prior approval (AED 10,000). The finance department has not provided prior approval for this purchase as indicated by ""Prior_Finance_Approval: Yes"". Therefore, it is necessary to seek approval from the finance department before proceeding with this transaction."
T091,02-10-24,11208.34,Vendor D,PO1715,Invoice,2.84%,,No,12-10-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,Yes," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction with Transaction ID T091 does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in point 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) of the purchase policy document, as the transaction amount of AED 11,208.34 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, even though there is a 'Yes' for Department_Authorization, it should only be required if the amount is above AED 5,000, not AED 10,000."
T092,26-07-24,12653.6,Vendor F,PO1333,Purchase,17.87%,Special promotion applied,Yes,24-08-24,No,Laptops,Yes," Yes, the transaction appears to violate multiple policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount (AED 12,653.6) exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor F is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor (Vendor A, C, E, G, or I).

3. Discounts: The discount percentage (17.87%) exceeds the allowable limit of 15%. Additionally, it seems that there's no justification for the discount mentioned in the transaction data."
T093,15-10-24,3401.65,Vendor H,PO1626,Invoice,1.02%,,Yes,14-11-24,No,Server Maintenance,Yes,No violation
T094,26-08-24,2815.76,Vendor A,PO1210,Purchase,11.41%,,Yes,09-09-24,No,Consulting Services,Yes," No, the transaction does not violate any policy constraints as stated in the provided Purchase Policy Document. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 2815.76, which is below the single transaction limit of AED 10,000.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (09-09-24) is within the allowed 30 days of the purchase date (26-08-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor A, is listed as a procurement-approved vendor.
4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction does not involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so it's not applicable in this case.
5. Discounts: Although the discount percentage (11.41%) is above the stated limit of 15%, there's no justification provided for the discount. However, since the policy mentions that invoices with discounts above 15% ""must"" include a justification from the vendor and internal approval, it can be inferred that the system or an auditor may flag this transaction due to lack of justification, but it doesn't necessarily mean the transaction violates the policy.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is below AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: Since there's no information about duplicate invoices in this case, it's not possible to determine if the transaction violates this policy constraint."
T095,16-07-24,8002.3,Vendor C,PO1983,Invoice,15.25%,Special promotion applied,Yes,16-07-24,No,IT Equipment,Yes,No violation

T097,13-07-24,9759.16,Vendor I,PO1189,Invoice,21.15%,,No,18-07-24,Yes,IT Equipment,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount on this invoice (21.15%) exceeds the allowed 15% without justification. Although the field for justification is empty, it's not clear if the system automatically calculates this value or if the user is supposed to fill it in manually. Regardless, according to the policy, any discount above 15% requires a justification.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction has 'No' for tax paid when all purchases should include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Since we don't know if Vendor I is tax-exempt, this policy is violated."
T098,15-07-24,8110.23,Vendor B,PO1197,Invoice,24.99%,Special promotion applied,No,26-07-24,No,Printer Supplies,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Point 3): The vendor, Vendor B, is not listed as a procurement approved vendor in the given list (Vendor A, C, E, G, I).
2. Discounts (Point 5): The discount percentage of 24.99% exceeds the threshold of 15%. Since there's a justification provided for the discount (""Special promotion applied""), further review is required to determine if the justification is valid and meets the necessary criteria for approval."
T099,06-10-24,2424.58,Vendor C,PO1508,Purchase,9.58%,,Yes,08-11-24,Yes,Consulting Services,Yes," No, the transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints based on the provided information. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is less than AED 10,000, so prior approval from the finance department is not required.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission date (08-11-24) is within the 30 days of the purchase date (06-10-24), so it is within the deadline.
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor C is a procurement-approved vendor, as mentioned in the provided vendors list.
4. Multiple Purchases: There is no information about previous transactions from the same vendor within the past 7 days to compare against the total limit of AED 20,000.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (9.58%) is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification is required.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments, as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is more than AED 5,000, and department authorization is indicated as ""Yes"", so it is approved by the department head.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There is no information suggesting that a duplicate invoice has been received for this purchase order."
T100,03-09-24,12976.22,Vendor C,PO1560,Purchase,21.77%,,No,15-09-24,No,Server Maintenance,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of 12976.22 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Although there is a Yes for Prior_Finance_Approval, it should only be required when the purchase exceeds AED 10,000, not for purchases less than that amount.

2. Discounts: The discount provided in this transaction (21.77%) is more than the allowed 15% limit without justification. Although there is no Discount_Justification provided, it should be required when a discount exceeds 15%."
T101,13-09-24,2278.04,Vendor E,PO1455,Invoice,24.87%,Special promotion applied,No,26-09-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount on this invoice (24.87%) is above the 15% threshold specified in the policy. According to the policy, any discounts exceeding 15% require justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, there's no justification provided in the transaction data.

2. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount is AED 2278.04, which is greater than AED 10,000 (the maximum purchase limit without prior approval from the finance department). However, it seems that there's no prior finance approval mentioned in the transaction data."
T102,22-07-24,8335.05,Vendor C,PO1873,Invoice,15.29%,Special promotion applied,No,20-08-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraint regarding discounts (point 5). The discount of 15.29% exceeds the maximum allowed discount of 15%. Since there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field for the excess discount, it does not meet the requirement specified in the policy."
T103,05-09-24,5392.51,Vendor H,PO1669,Invoice,20.12%,Special promotion applied,No,09-09-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to the Vendor Restrictions policy (point 3) as the vendor 'Vendor H' is not listed among the Procurement Approved Vendors provided. According to the policy, purchases can only be made from vendors who are pre-approved by the procurement department. In this case, 'Vendor H' does not meet that requirement."
T104,22-07-24,11001.74,Vendor B,PO1824,Purchase,10.50%,,No,23-08-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) as the purchase amount of AED 11001.74 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it also seems to violate policy constraint number 7 (Purchase Authorization) as there is no Department_Authorization mentioned in the provided data for this purchase that exceeds AED 5,000. Lastly, since vendor B is not listed under Procurement Approved Vendors, it might be in violation of policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions) although more information about the vendor's pre-approval status would be needed to confirm this."
T105,27-07-24,10470.29,Vendor A,PO1954,Invoice,17.62%,Special promotion applied,No,28-07-24,Yes,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) as the amount of AED 10470.29 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) since the discount (17.62%) is above 15% of the original price and does not include justification from the vendor and internal approval."
T106,19-07-24,7063.11,Vendor H,PO1637,Invoice,18.06%,Special promotion applied,Yes,24-07-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) because the invoice has a discount of 18.06%, which is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for this high discount in the Discount_Justification field. According to the policy, any invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, there is no such justification provided."
T107,15-09-24,2344.74,Vendor G,PO1452,Purchase,21.93%,,Yes,10-10-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to the Discounts section of the policy (point 5). The discount percentage for this transaction is above 15% (21.93%) but there is no justification provided for the discount in the transaction file data fields (Discount_Justification field is empty). According to the policy, any invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the justification is missing."
T108,18-10-24,4022,Vendor H,PO1362,Purchase,18.61%,Special promotion applied,Yes,06-11-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Discounts section of the Purchase Policy Document (Policy 5). In this case, the discount percentage (18.61%) is more than 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the discount in the transaction data (Discount_Justification field is not empty but does not provide a justification that meets the policy requirement). Therefore, the transaction should be flagged for review due to this discrepancy."
T109,06-10-24,4116.09,Vendor H,PO1329,Invoice,4.40%,,Yes,25-10-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are the relevant comparisons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit (Single Transaction): The purchase amount is AED 4116.09, which is below AED 10,000. No prior approval from the finance department was required for this transaction since it does not exceed the limit.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (25-10-24), as it was submitted on or before the deadline.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction is from vendor H, which is not listed in the Procurement Approved Vendors list. However, if there are other means to ensure that the vendor has been pre-approved by the procurement department, then this transaction would still comply with the policy.

4. Multiple Purchases: This is an isolated purchase and does not involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so it doesn't violate this constraint.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (4.40%) is less than 15%, so there is no need for justification or internal approval as per the policy.

6. Tax Compliance: The tax was paid, as indicated by ""Yes"" in the 'Tax Paid' field.

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount is below AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: Since there is no information about a duplicate invoice for this transaction, it would be difficult to determine if this constraint has been violated without additional context or data.

In summary, this transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints based on the provided information."
T110,13-07-24,9184.72,Vendor G,PO1685,Invoice,24.00%,Special promotion applied,No,15-07-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage (24.00%) on the invoice is more than 15% of the original price. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, no such justification has been provided.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as it is marked as ""No"" for Tax Paid. According to the policy, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. In this case, there's no information indicating that the vendor is tax-exempt.

Both of these issues require attention and action to ensure compliance with the purchasing policy."
T111,23-07-24,8880.04,Vendor E,PO1123,Invoice,23.60%,Special promotion applied,Yes,18-08-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage on this invoice (23.60%) is above the allowed limit of 15%. According to the policy, any invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since no such justification or approval has been provided in this case, it violates the policy.
2. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount (8880.04 AED) exceeds the limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Although the transaction is an invoice and not a purchase, it still requires prior approval if the amount exceeds AED 10,000. Since no such approval has been provided in this case, it violates the policy."
T112,11-09-24,4635.48,Vendor F,PO1197,Invoice,20.03%,Special promotion applied,No,29-09-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions (3): The transaction was made with a vendor (Vendor F) that is not pre-approved by the procurement department. According to the policy, purchases can only be made from vendors who are pre-approved.

2. Discounts (5): The discount percentage for this invoice is 20.03%, which exceeds the 15% threshold stated in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for this discount in the transaction data (Discount_Justification field is empty). According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

3. Prior Finance Approval (7): The transaction amount is AED 4635.48 which is less than AED 10,000 but it does not have prior finance department approval in the Prior_Finance_Approval field. According to the policy, purchases that exceed AED 10,000 require prior approval from the finance department. Since the amount is below this limit, it should still have the approval field filled to comply with the policy.

Even though the transaction does not exceed the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval (AED 10,000), and it was submitted within the invoice submission deadline (within 30 days of the purchase date), and it seems to be a multiple purchase of laptops that doesn't exceed AED 20,000 in total over a 7-day period, these issues with vendor approval, discounts, and prior finance approval make this transaction non-compliant with the policy."
T113,14-10-24,5276.12,Vendor B,PO1620,Invoice,14.88%,,Yes,03-11-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T113 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a brief explanation:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 5276.12, which is well below the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000. No prior approval from finance department was required since the transaction amount did not exceed AED 10,000.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice for transaction T113 was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (03-11-24 minus 14-10-24 equals 29 days), so it meets the submission deadline requirement.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor in question, Vendor B, is not listed as a procurement approved vendor, which would result in a violation if this was the only purchase from this vendor. However, since there is no information about previous transactions with Vendor B, it's impossible to confirm if this transaction violates the vendor restrictions policy.

4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction data does not specify any additional purchases within the last 7 days for comparison, so we cannot determine whether this transaction violates the multiple purchases constraint.

5. Discounts: The discount on this transaction (14.88%) is above the 15% threshold mentioned in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for the discount, which would be a violation of the policy if the transaction involved vendors who provide discounts above 15%.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment (Tax Paid: Yes), so it meets this requirement.

7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is less than AED 5,000, and the department head authorization is 'Yes', indicating that the department head approved the purchase if it was above AED 5,000. Since the amount is below this limit, no violation occurred.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about duplicate invoices in the given transaction data, so we cannot determine whether this transaction violates the duplicate invoices policy."
T114,16-08-24,5765.93,Vendor E,PO1590,Purchase,16.96%,Special promotion applied,No,12-09-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints for the following reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount given on this purchase (16.96%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. However, there is a justification provided by the vendor for the special promotion applied. According to the policy, such invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the justification has been provided, but it's unclear if the internal approval was obtained.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as indicated by 'Tax Paid: No'. According to policy 6, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Transactions missing tax details will be flagged. In this case, the transaction lacks necessary tax information and should be flagged for review."
T115,27-08-24,11886.88,Vendor H,PO1893,Purchase,7.15%,,Yes,30-09-24,No,Security System Installation,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. The violation is in the Maximum Purchase Limit rule. The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department, as stated in point 1 of the policy. Even though prior_finance_approval is marked as 'Yes' in this case, it should still be within the specified limit for the rule to be complied with."
T116,19-09-24,3073.03,Vendor G,PO1912,Invoice,12.93%,,Yes,01-10-24,Yes,Laptops,Yes," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T116 does not appear to violate any of the specified policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of why this transaction complies with the given policies:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (3073.03 AED) is less than AED 10,000, so it doesn't require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission date (01-10-24) is within 30 days of the purchase date (19-09-24), so it is compliant with the policy.
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor G is one of the procurement approved vendors, so this transaction also follows the policy.
4. Multiple Purchases: There is no information provided about any previous transactions involving the same item and vendor within the last 7 days, so it's not possible to determine compliance with this rule.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (12.93%) is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification is required as per the policy.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment details, so it complies with the stated policy.
7. Purchase Authorization: The department head authorization (Yes) is provided for this transaction, and the amount is less than AED 5,000, which makes it compliant with the given policy.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about duplicate invoices in this scenario, so it's not possible to determine compliance with this rule.

In summary, based on the provided transaction data and policy constraints, transaction T116 appears to be compliant with all given policies."
T117,17-09-24,13271.96,Vendor H,PO1136,Invoice,20.89%,Special promotion applied,No,03-10-24,No,Consulting Services,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints.

1) Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor H) is not on the list of procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). As per the policy, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department.

2) Discounts: The discount percentage (20.89%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. Although there is a justification provided for the discount, the policy states that invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since no internal approval is mentioned in the transaction data, this violates the policy."

T120,20-08-24,3720.27,Vendor G,PO1342,Invoice,13.21%,,Yes,01-09-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in the ""Discounts"" section of the policy. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the transaction has a discount of 13.21%, which exceeds the 15% threshold, but there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field. Therefore, it violates the policy requirement for proper documentation and approval when issuing invoices with such high discounts."
T121,03-09-24,10785.73,Vendor E,PO1564,Purchase,24.48%,,Yes,21-09-24,No,Security System Installation,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1, Maximum Purchase Limit. The purchase amount is 10,785.73 AED which exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department."
T122,12-08-24,12542.89,Vendor I,PO1292,Purchase,18.17%,Special promotion applied,No,03-09-24,Yes,Office Computers,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraint related to discounts (Policy #5). The invoice for this transaction has a discount of 18.17%, which is above the allowed limit of 15%. Although there is justification provided by the vendor and internal approval, the policy states that any discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Therefore, this transaction violates the stated policy."
T123,14-08-24,6948.59,Vendor I,PO1146,Purchase,1.83%,,Yes,16-08-24,No,Security System Installation,Yes," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the given transaction (T123) does not violate any of the policy constraints. Here is an explanation for each relevant constraint:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 6948.59 which is less than the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval (Prior_Finance_Approval: Yes)
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission deadline is within the required period since the submitted date (16-08-24) is after the purchase date (14-08-24), and 16-08-24 is less than 30 days from 14-08-24.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction vendor, Vendor I, is a procurement approved vendor (Vendor I is present in the list of Procurement Approved Vendors).
4. Multiple Purchases: There is no information on any previous transactions within the last 7 days to compare against the AED 20,000 limit. However, based on the provided data, it does not seem that this transaction violates the policy for multiple purchases.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (1.83%) is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification or internal approval is required.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7. Purchase Authorization: Since the amount (AED 6948.59) is less than AED 5,000, no department head authorization is required (Department_Authorization: No).
8. Duplicate Invoices: There is no information indicating that this transaction is a duplicate invoice for the same purchase order."
T124,30-08-24,7828.97,Vendor F,PO1821,Purchase,24.71%,Special promotion applied,Yes,11-09-24,No,IT Equipment,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint 5 (Discounts) because the discount provided (24.71%) exceeds the limit of 15% of the original price without justification. According to the policy, any invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, there is no such justification provided in the transaction data."
T125,09-09-24,10994.4,Vendor F,PO1747,Invoice,10.30%,,No,06-10-24,No,Software Subscription,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. Specifically, it violates the ""Maximum Purchase Limit"" rule as the transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (as per point 1 of the policy). Additionally, since there is no justification for the high discount provided by the vendor (Discount > 15%), it also violates the ""Discounts"" rule if we consider that the Discount_Justification field is empty. However, given that Prior_Finance_Approval is 'Yes', this indicates that there was prior approval from the finance department, which resolves one of the issues mentioned above. Nevertheless, as the amount exceeds AED 10,000 without the required department authorization (Department_Authorization: No), the transaction still violates the policy."
T126,12-08-24,7005.25,Vendor D,PO1229,Invoice,20.61%,,No,14-08-24,Yes,IT Equipment,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraints in two ways:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage for this transaction (20.61%) is above the 15% limit set by the policy. According to rule 5, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, in this case, there is no justification provided for the discount.

2. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor D) for this transaction is not listed as one of the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). According to rule 3, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department. In this case, Vendor D is not on the list of approved vendors."
T127,16-09-24,6978,Vendor E,PO1075,Purchase,23.03%,Special promotion applied,No,25-09-24,No,Conference Room Setup,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage (23.03%) is more than 15% of the original price. However, there is no justification provided for this high discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, which goes against policy #5.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as indicated by 'Tax Paid: No', which violates policy #6. All purchases should either include tax details or be from a tax-exempt vendor. In this case, the vendor is approved and known (Vendor E), so tax should have been included in the purchase.

3. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction has 'Prior_Finance_Approval: Yes', but the amount does not exceed AED 10,000. According to policy #1, finance approval is only needed for transactions above AED 10,000. In this case, the purchase amount (6978 AED) falls below the threshold that requires prior finance approval."
T128,28-09-24,2457.95,Vendor E,PO1683,Invoice,14.43%,,No,12-10-24,No,Software Subscription,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The policy states that invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification (Discount_Justification field in transactions.csv). In this case, there is no justification provided for the discount. Therefore, it does not comply with the 'Discounts' section of the Purchase Policy Document."
T129,30-08-24,4543.31,Vendor F,PO1250,Purchase,17.16%,Special promotion applied,No,23-09-24,No,Consulting Services,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints.

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor F) is not on the list of pre-approved vendors by the procurement department, which is a violation of policy point 3.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage (17.16%) exceeds the allowed threshold of 15% without a justification from the vendor and internal approval, which is a violation of policy point 5."
T130,04-07-24,12063.11,Vendor C,PO1446,Invoice,11.24%,,Yes,09-07-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The invoice amount (12063.11 AED) exceeds the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction does not have prior finance approval as it exceeds the limit and has a value greater than 10,000 AED.

3. Invoice Submission Deadline: Although this transaction is within the submission deadline (9-07-24 vs 30 days from the purchase date), future transactions from the same vendor should be monitored to ensure they are submitted on time.

While there might not be any other policy constraints violated in this specific transaction, the lack of prior finance approval and exceeding the maximum purchase limit make it non-compliant with the given policies."
T131,10-07-24,5064.11,Vendor B,PO1234,Purchase,19.99%,Special promotion applied,No,12-07-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Discounts policy (point 5 in the Purchase Policy Document). The transaction has a discount of 19.99%, which is above the 15% threshold specified in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for this large discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to the policy, all invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since there is no justification given for the discount in this transaction, it violates the policy."
T132,02-08-24,4939.71,Vendor I,PO1757,Purchase,14.82%,,No,04-09-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T132 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints.

Here are some reasons for this assessment:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 4939.71 which is less than AED 10,000, so no prior approval from the finance department is required.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date for this transaction (04-09-24) is within the allowed 30 days of the purchase date (02-08-24), so it meets the deadline requirement.

3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor I is a procurement-approved vendor, so this transaction does not violate the vendor restriction policy.

4. Multiple Purchases: This transaction represents a single purchase, so there's no need to consider multiple purchases within a 7-day period or total limits for such purchases.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (14.82%) is above the threshold of 15%, but there is no justification provided in the data. However, since the transaction does not require prior finance approval, it seems that an exception has been made for this specific case or that the justification may be found elsewhere.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction indicates ""No"" for tax paid, which aligns with the policy requirement if the vendor is tax-exempt.

7. Purchase Authorization: The department head authorization (Yes) is provided in the data, and since the amount is less than AED 5,000, it meets the purchase authorization requirement.

8. Duplicate Invoices: Since there's no information about receiving another invoice for the same purchase order, this transaction does not violate the duplicate invoices policy constraint.

In summary, the transaction T132 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints based on the provided data and policy details."
T133,15-09-24,10179.35,Vendor E,PO1943,Purchase,8.91%,,Yes,09-10-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1. The transaction amount is AED 10,179.35 which exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department as stated in the policy. Additionally, since there is no prior finance approval (Prior_Finance_Approval: No) for this transaction and the amount exceeds AED 10,000, it violates the policy."
T134,01-10-24,11129.24,Vendor B,PO1910,Purchase,12.89%,,No,02-10-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions) as Vendor B is not listed as a Procurement Approved Vendor in the provided list (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). Therefore, purchases cannot be made from this vendor without prior approval. Additionally, it violates policy constraint number 7 (Purchase Authorization) since the amount exceeds AED 5,000 but does not have department head authorization indicated as 'Yes' in the 'Department_Authorization' field."
T135,06-09-24,12824.61,Vendor D,PO1183,Purchase,16.37%,Special promotion applied,No,11-09-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 12,824.61 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval).

2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The field shows 'No', indicating that no prior finance approval was given, but this is required because the purchase amount exceeds AED 10,000.

3. Discounts: The discount on this invoice is 16.37%, which is above the 15% threshold set by the policy. However, there is a justification provided for the discount (Special promotion applied), but since prior finance approval was not given, the transaction still violates the policy.

4. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount of AED 12,824.61 requires authorization from the department head if it exceeds AED 5,000. Since the 'Department_Authorization' field shows 'Yes', this indicates that the purchase amount is above AED 5,000, but without prior finance approval for a purchase over AED 10,000, the transaction violates the policy.

In summary, the transaction violates policies regarding Maximum Purchase Limit, Prior_Finance_Approval, and Discounts, as well as Purchase Authorization due to the lack of prior finance approval for a purchase over AED 10,000."
T136,13-10-24,5896.3,Vendor F,PO1458,Purchase,8.69%,,Yes,17-11-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are some reasons for my answer:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 5896.3, which is below the single transaction limit of AED 10,000.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (17-11-24) falls within the 30-day window from the purchase date (13-10-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor F is not listed as a procurement approved vendor, but this policy violation does not apply since the transaction is a purchase, not an invoice.
4. Multiple Purchases: This constraint refers to multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period, which is not applicable in this case.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (8.69%) is below the threshold of 15%. No justification is required for the transaction.
6. Tax Compliance: The tax was paid, as indicated by ""Yes"" under the ""Tax Paid"" field.
7. Purchase Authorization: The amount of the transaction (AED 5896.3) is below AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: This constraint refers to duplicate invoices for the same purchase order. Since this is a purchase record, there is no related invoice to compare, making it impossible to determine if there are any duplicate invoices.

In conclusion, the transaction does not violate any of the stated policy constraints in the provided policy document."
T137,04-09-24,12544.34,Vendor G,PO1644,Invoice,1.23%,,No,13-09-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) because the purchase amount of AED 12544.34 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it does not comply with policy constraint number 7 (Purchase Authorization) because there is a department head authorization (Yes), but the purchase amount is more than AED 5,000 and should require authorization. Lastly, it doesn't have prior finance approval for the transaction since the amount exceeds AED 10,000."
T138,05-09-24,4110.12,Vendor G,PO1052,Purchase,8.00%,,Yes,21-09-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the given transaction (T138) does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are the reasons for this assessment:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 4,110.12, which is well below the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date for this transaction (21-09-24) falls within the 30-day window following the purchase date (05-09-24), so it meets the invoice submission deadline requirement.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction vendor, Vendor G, is listed as one of the procurement approved vendors.

4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about previous transactions from the same vendor in the given data, so it's impossible to determine if this transaction violates the multiple purchases constraint.

5. Discounts: The discount provided in this transaction (8%) is within the allowed range of 15% or lower, so no justification is required according to the policy.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment information and states that tax was paid (Yes), so it meets the tax compliance requirement.

7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is below AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required for this specific transaction.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about duplicate invoices in the given data, so it's impossible to determine if this constraint was violated.

In summary, the provided transaction (T138) does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints as long as there are no additional transactions or vendor-specific policies that might affect the assessment."
T139,06-10-24,2672.68,Vendor F,PO1923,Purchase,12.30%,,No,11-10-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is with respect to the ""Vendor Restrictions"" (Policy 3) as Vendor F is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). This means that this purchase cannot be made from Vendor F without prior approval from the procurement department."
T140,14-10-24,9015.41,Vendor D,PO1189,Invoice,23.82%,Special promotion applied,No,23-10-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) and possibly number 8 (Duplicate Invoices). The discount of 23.82% is more than the allowed 15%, but no justification for the discount has been provided in the Discount_Justification field, which is a requirement as per policy 5. Additionally, if there was a previous invoice for the same purchase order (PO1189), and it wasn't marked as duplicate or flagged, then this transaction could potentially violate constraint number 8 on no duplicate invoices being allowed."
T141,10-09-24,8279.55,Vendor I,PO1767,Invoice,21.78%,,No,18-09-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 - Discounts. The discount percentage of 21.78% exceeds the policy limit of 15%. However, there is no justification provided for this high discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, which is a violation of the policy."
T142,21-09-24,6061.33,Vendor H,PO1905,Purchase,16.94%,Special promotion applied,Yes,10-10-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints for the following reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Violated): The vendor, Vendor H, is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor in the provided list. Therefore, this purchase should not have been made from this vendor.

2. Discounts (Partially Violated): The discount percentage on this transaction exceeds the 15% threshold specified by policy. However, there is a justification for the discount provided (Special promotion applied). According to the policy, any invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since we do not have information about whether this transaction received internal approval, it's unclear if the policy has been fully complied with in regards to the discount.

In conclusion, there are two potential violations of company policy: one regarding the vendor used for the purchase, and another (possibly) concerning the discount applied, depending on whether an internal approval was obtained for the high discount percentage."
T143,23-07-24,13736.31,Vendor B,PO1707,Purchase,16.35%,Special promotion applied,No,28-07-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the specific violations:

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor B) is not listed among the procurement approved vendors. According to the policy, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage in this transaction is 16.35%, which exceeds the 15% threshold stated in the policy. Even though a justification for the discount was provided, it's required that invoices with discounts above 15% must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, there's no indication that such approval was given in this case.

3. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction amount is AED 13736.31, which exceeds AED 10,000 (the maximum purchase limit without prior approval). However, the 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field indicates that no such approval was given.

It is recommended to review and address these issues before proceeding with this transaction."
T144,05-10-24,8023.61,Vendor G,PO1788,Purchase,21.28%,,Yes,23-10-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts). The discount percentage provided is 21.28%, which is above the allowed 15% without a justification specified in the Discount_Justification field. Therefore, the invoice does not comply with the policy requirement for discounts."
T145,21-07-24,6125.28,Vendor E,PO1397,Purchase,18.02%,Special promotion applied,No,24-07-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage for this transaction (18.02%) is above the 15% threshold specified in the Purchase Policy Document (Policy 5). Therefore, it requires a justification from the vendor and internal approval, which does not appear to be present in the provided data.

2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction exceeds AED 10,000 and does not have prior finance department approval. According to the policy (Policy 1), purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. In this case, there is no 'Prior_Finance_Approval' of 'Yes' in the provided data, indicating that the finance department has not approved this transaction."
T146,22-09-24,7689.81,Vendor B,PO1373,Invoice,13.72%,,No,23-09-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints.

1. Vendor Restrictions (Violation of point 3): The vendor named ""Vendor B"" is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor in the given list of vendors, which are: Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, and Vendor I.

2. Tax Compliance (Violation of point 6): The transaction has ""Tax Paid: No"", while the policy states that all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Since we don't have any information about the vendor being tax-exempt, this transaction violates the policy."
T147,02-08-24,10632.68,Vendor C,PO1593,Purchase,24.14%,Special promotion applied,No,11-08-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts). The discount percentage of 24.14% is above the 15% threshold specified in the policy. Additionally, since there is no justification provided for this high discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, it further violates the policy requirement for justifying discounts above 15%. The transaction also does not have prior finance approval as required by constraint number 7 because 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field indicates 'No'. However, since the policy states that purchases exceeding AED 10,000 require prior finance approval, it may still be in violation of that constraint even if we ignore the discount issue. Lastly, it is worth noting that the transaction was submitted 9 days late (since the submission date is 11-08-24 and the invoice submission deadline is within 30 days of the purchase date), which violates policy constraint number 2 (Invoice Submission Deadline)."
T148,02-09-24,12109.91,Vendor G,PO1761,Purchase,11.93%,,No,10-09-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints for two reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department, which is a violation of Policy 1.

2. Purchase Authorization: The transaction does not have authorization from the department head, as indicated by the ""Department_Authorization"" field being 'No'. According to Policy 7, purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head, and this transaction amount (12,109.91 AED) exceeds that limit."
T149,10-10-24,10498.08,Vendor C,PO1956,Invoice,19.07%,Special promotion applied,Yes,26-10-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates Policy Constraint 5 (Discounts) and Policy Constraint 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit). The discount of 19.07% is above the allowed limit of 15%. Also, while the department authorization has been given for this transaction as it exceeds AED 5,000, it should have prior finance approval as the amount exceeds AED 10,000. Therefore, the transaction violates both Policy Constraint 5 and 1."
T150,14-10-24,12744.15,Vendor G,PO1350,Purchase,0.80%,,No,02-11-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 7 - Purchase Authorization. The reason being that the amount of the transaction (AED 12,744.15) exceeds AED 5,000, but the field 'Department_Authorization' indicates that authorization was received from the department head. However, according to the policy, purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization. Although the purchase was approved by the finance department (as indicated by 'Prior_Finance_Approval: Yes'), it should also have received authorization from the department head (Department_Authorization: No). Therefore, the transaction violates policy constraint number 7."

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 2477.01 which is less than AED 10,000. No prior approval from the finance department is required.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date for this transaction (07-10-24) falls within the 30 days window of the purchase date (21-09-24).

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor A, is listed as a procurement approved vendor.

4. Multiple Purchases: This is a single transaction, so there's no issue with multiple purchases within a 7-day period.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (1.84%) is less than the 15% threshold, so no justification or internal approval is required.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount of this transaction (AED 2477.01) is less than AED 5,000, so no authorization from the department head is required.

The violation is in relation to the Maximum Purchase Limit rule (Point 1). The transaction amount of AED 13,150.61 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Even though Department_Authorization is Yes, it does not override this specific policy constraint since the authorization should be granted after verifying that the purchase amount complies with the stated limit."

The violation is related to the Discounts policy (point 5). The discount percentage given for this transaction (22.36%) exceeds the allowed maximum of 15% of the original price without proper justification in the Discount_Justification field. Therefore, 'Yes', the transaction violates the policy constraint."

1. Vendor Restrictions (Violation): The vendor, Vendor H, is not in the list of procurement approved vendors.
2. Discounts (Violation): The discount percentage provided by the vendor exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. There is also no justification provided for this high discount.
3. Prior Finance Approval (Compliance): Since the transaction amount is above AED 10,000 and prior finance approval is Yes, it complies with the policy. However, the vendor issue mentioned earlier invalidates this compliance."
T158,26-08-24,14804.59,Vendor G,PO1934,Invoice,2.08%,,No,04-09-24,No,Software Subscription,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The maximum purchase limit states that purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. However, in this case, the transaction amount (AED 14,804.59) is greater than AED 10,000 and also the 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field indicates that there was prior approval, which is contradictory as per the policy. This inconsistency suggests that either the prior approval was not required or the prior approval amount should have been more than AED 10,000 based on the transaction value. Additionally, the 'Tax Paid' field shows that tax was not paid, which also violates policy constraint 6, as all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt."
T159,21-08-24,4198.95,Vendor I,PO1230,Purchase,23.78%,Special promotion applied,Yes,09-09-24,No,Conference Room Setup,Yes," Based on the provided policy document, the transaction T159 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of how it aligns with each constraint:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (4198.95 AED) is less than 10,000 AED, so it doesn't require prior finance approval.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date of the transaction (09-09-24) falls within the allowed 30 days of the purchase date (assuming the purchase date is before 09-09-21 due to the date format).
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor I) is included in the list of procurement approved vendors.
4. Multiple Purchases: Since there's no information about other transactions within a 7-day period, it's not possible to determine if this transaction violates the multiple purchases constraint.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (23.78%) is above the stated limit of 15%, but there is a justification provided (Special promotion applied). Therefore, this transaction complies with the policy.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as it states ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (4198.95 AED) is less than 5,000 AED, so it doesn't require authorization from the department head.
8. Duplicate Invoices: Since there's no information about other invoices for the same purchase order (PO1230), it's not possible to determine if this transaction violates the duplicate invoices constraint.

In summary, the transaction T159 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints based on the provided data."

1. Maximum Purchase Limit : The amount of the transaction (AED 10687.39) exceeds the maximum purchase limit without prior approval from the finance department (AED 10,000).

2. Discounts : The discount percentage (17.98%) on this invoice is above the threshold of 15% of the original price. According to the policy, any invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

1. Maximum Purchase Limit (Single Transaction): The amount of this transaction exceeds AED 10,000, and prior finance approval was not obtained. According to the policy, purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Purchase Authorization: Although the transaction amount is above AED 5,000, there's no record of authorization from the department head. According to the policy, purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head.

3. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction does not show prior finance approval for a purchase over AED 10,000, which is required as per the policy."

The violation is in the ""Discounts"" section of the policy. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the discount (17.86%) exceeds the allowed threshold (15%) and there is no mention of justification or internal approval in the provided transaction details.

The policy states in point 5 that ""Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval."" In this case, the invoice has a discount of 18.41%, which is above the 15% threshold set by the policy. Additionally, there is no mention of internal approval for this transaction in the provided data. Therefore, the transaction violates both the discount policy and the prior finance approval policy."

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount of AED 11,021.4 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (as per policy point 1).

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments (Tax Paid: No) when it should, unless the vendor is tax-exempt. This contradicts policy point 6. However, if Vendor E is tax-exempt, this violation can be considered resolved. It's important to verify that Vendor E has been approved as a tax-exempt vendor by the procurement department."

The reason for this is that the amount of the transaction (AED 4082.57) exceeds the maximum purchase limit without prior approval from the finance department as stated in point 1 of the policy: ""Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department."" Additionally, there is no Department_Authorization recorded for this transaction, indicating that it might not be authorized if its value is greater than AED 5,000."
T168,25-08-24,14713.07,Vendor I,PO1005,Purchase,17.70%,Special promotion applied,No,20-09-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints for the following reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount of AED 14,713.07 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Discounts: The discount (17.70%) is above the allowed 15% limit, and there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

3. Purchase Authorization: The transaction does not have Department_Authorization set to 'Yes', but since the amount exceeds AED 5,000, it should have been authorized by the department head according to the policy.

Regarding the other policy constraints, the following points are either not relevant or have no information provided in the given transaction data:
- Invoice Submission Deadline (Submitted Date is within 30 days of the purchase date)
- Vendor Restrictions (Vendor I is a procurement approved vendor)
- Multiple Purchases (there's no information about previous transactions involving the same item)
- Tax Compliance (Tax Paid is set to 'No', but it's not clear if the vendor should be tax-exempt or not, and there are no missing tax details in this case)
- Duplicate Invoices (there's no information about previous invoices with the same purchase order ID)"
T169,08-10-24,2590.82,Vendor B,PO1942,Invoice,24.43%,,No,03-11-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in point 5 of the Purchase Policy Document which states that ""Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval."" In this case, the Discount percentage for transaction T169 is 24.43%, which is greater than 15%. However, there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field for this transaction, making it non-compliant with the policy."
T170,16-10-24,5478.91,Vendor G,PO1211,Purchase,1.53%,,Yes,24-10-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Based on the provided policy, the transaction T170 does not appear to violate any of the specified policy constraints. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit : The purchase amount (5478.91 AED) is well below the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline : The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (24-10-24). Any potential issues will be flagged for review if it is submitted later than 30 days.
3. Vendor Restrictions : Vendor G is listed as a procurement approved vendor, so this constraint is not violated.
4. Multiple Purchases : This policy does not seem to apply because there is no information about previous transactions from the same vendor within a 7-day period.
5. Discounts : The discount percentage (1.53%) is below the threshold of 15% of the original price, so no justification or internal approval is needed.
6. Tax Compliance : The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Yes"" for Tax Paid.
7. Purchase Authorization : Since the purchase amount (5478.91 AED) is below the authorization limit of AED 5,000, department head authorization is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices : There's no information about duplicate invoices for this transaction.

Therefore, the answer is 'No'. The transaction does not appear to violate any policy constraints as stated in the provided description."
T171,08-08-24,6737.37,Vendor C,PO1879,Invoice,22.71%,,No,25-08-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraints for the following reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount (22.71%) is above 15% of the original price (not provided in the given data), which requires a justification and internal approval as per the Purchase Policy Document. However, there is no 'Discount_Justification' provided in the transaction data.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments (Tax Paid: No), but according to the policy, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt, which could result in a flagged transaction. It is assumed that the vendor is not tax-exempt since no such information was provided.

Regarding the other policy constraints, the transaction does not exceed the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction (AED 10,000), it was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (25-08-24 is within 30 days from 08-08-24), and it was made from a pre-approved vendor (Vendor C). The transaction amount does not require department head authorization or prior finance approval. There are no multiple purchases within the 7-day period to evaluate, as this information is also missing in the provided data."
T172,14-08-24,6726.7,Vendor D,PO1193,Purchase,5.97%,,Yes,07-09-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Based on the given policy constraints, the transaction T172 does not appear to violate any of them. Here is a brief explanation:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (6726.7 AED) is less than 10,000 AED, so no prior approval from the finance department is required.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date of the transaction (07-09-24) is within 30 days of the purchase date (assuming the purchase date is earlier than submission date), so it meets this requirement.

3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor D is not listed in the Procurement Approved Vendors, but the policy states ""Purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department."" Since we don't have information about whether this vendor was approved or not, it's unclear if this requirement is violated.

4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about previous transactions involving the same item, so we can't determine if this requirement is violated.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (5.97%) is less than 15%, so no justification is required.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments (Tax Paid: Yes), and the policy doesn't specify a requirement for tax details in case of purchases, so it meets this requirement.

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount is less than 5,000 AED, so no department head authorization is required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about duplicate invoices, so we can't determine if this requirement is violated.

Since none of the given policy constraints seem to be violated by transaction T172 (based on the provided data), the answer would be 'No'. However, as mentioned earlier, it's unclear about Vendor Restrictions and Duplicate Invoices due to lacking information."
T173,08-08-24,11294.7,Vendor B,PO1498,Invoice,15.13%,Special promotion applied,No,05-09-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions) and number 5 (Discounts). The vendor Vendor B is not on the list of procurement-approved vendors, which contradicts the policy. Additionally, the discount percentage on this invoice (15.13%) exceeds the threshold of 15% specified in the policy, but there is no justification provided for the discount, which is a violation of the policy as well."
T174,26-09-24,14790.4,Vendor D,PO1064,Invoice,8.82%,,Yes,27-10-24,Yes,Projector,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1: Maximum Purchase Limit. The transaction amount of AED 14,790.4 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, prior finance approval (Prior_Finance_Approval) is noted as 'Yes', but since the transaction amount exceeds the specified limit, this approval should have been obtained for a smaller amount or in multiple transactions."
T175,21-08-24,2389.32,Vendor H,PO1369,Invoice,2.47%,,Yes,31-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,Yes," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction with Transaction ID T175 does not appear to violate any of the explicitly stated policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of the comparison:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 2389.32, which is below AED 10,000 and doesn't require prior finance department approval according to the policy.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (31-08-24 minus 21-08-24 = 10 days, which is well within the 30-day deadline).
3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction vendor (Vendor H) is not listed as a procurement approved vendor, but there is no explicit policy violation in this case since it was approved prior to the purchase by the finance department.
4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information regarding multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period.
5. Discounts: The discount on the transaction (2.47%) is below 15% of the original price, so there's no need for justification or internal approval according to the policy.
6. Tax Compliance: The tax was paid as indicated in the transaction data (""Tax Paid: Yes"").
7. Purchase Authorization: The amount of the transaction is below AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required according to the policy.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information suggesting that this is a duplicate invoice.

However, it's essential to note that having Vendor H approved by the finance department doesn't comply with the Vendor Restrictions policy because it wasn't pre-approved by the procurement department. This could be addressed in future transactions by ensuring that all vendors are pre-approved by both the finance and procurement departments, or by clarifying the approval process for exceptions to the vendor restrictions policy."
T176,03-07-24,2677.64,Vendor A,PO1918,Invoice,3.20%,,No,11-07-24,No,Conference Room Setup,Yes,No violation
T177,06-10-24,2094.3,Vendor I,PO1311,Purchase,7.44%,,Yes,10-11-24,Yes,Laptops,Yes," Based on the provided policy document, the transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a summary of why it complies with each constraint:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit - The purchase amount (AED 2094.3) is below AED 10,000 for single transactions, so no prior approval from the finance department is required.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline - The invoice submission date (10-11-24) is within 30 days of the purchase date (06-10-24), so the transaction complies with this constraint.

3. Vendor Restrictions - The vendor (Vendor I) is listed as a procurement approved vendor, so purchases can be made from them.

4. Multiple Purchases - There is no information provided about previous transactions, but for this single transaction, the purchase amount is below AED 20,000 within a 7-day period.

5. Discounts - The discount percentage (7.44%) is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification is required.

6. Tax Compliance - The transaction includes tax payments as stated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".

7. Purchase Authorization - The department head authorization is given for this transaction (Department_Authorization: Yes) since the purchase amount is more than AED 5,000.

8. Duplicate Invoices - There is no indication of duplicate invoices in this single transaction.

So, based on the information provided, the transaction does not violate any policy constraints."
T178,12-09-24,11489.06,Vendor G,PO1428,Invoice,1.06%,,Yes,30-09-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,Yes," Based on the provided policy document, the transaction T178 appears to violate two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 11,489.06, which exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Although there is a 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field with a value of 'Yes', this field refers to prior finance department approval for amounts above AED 10,000. In this case, since the transaction amount exceeds the specified limit, it requires approval, but no such approval was provided in the policy document.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission date is 30-09-24, which is exactly on the 30th day of the purchase date (assuming the transaction date is 12-09-24). While the policy allows for invoices to be submitted within 30 days, it does not explicitly state that invoices can be submitted exactly on the 30th day. However, since the policy mentions that any invoices submitted later than 30 days will be flagged for review, it could be argued that the transaction violates this constraint as well.

So, the answer is 'Yes', the transaction T178 appears to violate at least two policy constraints."

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount of this transaction (AED 14,609.36) exceeds the single transaction limit without prior approval from the finance department (AED 10,000).

2. Discounts: The discount applied to this invoice is above the 15% threshold set by the policy (19.06% vs 15%), and there is no justification provided in the 'Discount_Justification' field as required."
T181,13-07-24,10636.04,Vendor D,PO1179,Invoice,0.60%,,No,31-07-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. Specifically, it violates the ""Maximum Purchase Limit"" rule (point 1) as the amount of AED 10636.04 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Although the transaction has Department_Authorization, it is still beyond the approved limit and requires prior finance approval, which was not provided in this case."

The transaction amount of AED 10691.18 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, the transaction also doesn't comply with policy constraint number 7 - Purchase Authorization because there is no Department_Authorization (No) mentioned in the data fields even though the amount exceeds AED 5,000."
T183,22-07-24,7438.04,Vendor G,PO1379,Invoice,23.31%,Special promotion applied,No,04-08-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,Yes," Based on the provided policy, the transaction does violate two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage for this invoice is above 15% (23.31%) without any justification mentioned in the Discount_Justification field of the transactions.csv file. According to policy point 5, all invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

2. Tax Compliance: This transaction has a missing tax detail (Tax Paid: No) while according to policy point 6, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Transactions missing tax details will be flagged as violating this policy.

So, the answer is 'Yes' and the transaction is in violation of two policies regarding discounts and tax compliance."
T184,24-09-24,14627.93,Vendor F,PO1938,Invoice,10.27%,,No,20-10-24,No,Conference Room Setup,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the specific reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount (AED 14,627.93) exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department, as stated in section 1 of the policy. In this case, prior finance approval was provided (Prior_Finance_Approval: Yes), but the amount still exceeds the limit without prior approval from the department head, as there is no value for Department_Authorization field indicating authorization for transactions above AED 5,000.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments (Tax Paid: No), which violates section 6 of the policy stating that all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt."
T185,01-09-24,13391.97,Vendor D,PO1487,Purchase,3.86%,,No,04-09-24,Yes,Security System Installation,Yes," Based on the provided policy, the transaction T185 violates the policy constraints because it exceeds the maximum purchase limit without prior approval from the finance department. The transaction amount of 13391.97 AED is above the limit of 10,000 AED for a single transaction that requires prior approval. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'. It violates policy point 1: Maximum Purchase Limit."
T186,12-09-24,3145.55,Vendor B,PO1356,Purchase,23.77%,Special promotion applied,Yes,23-09-24,Yes,Software Subscription,Yes," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraint number 5 (Discounts). The discount provided by Vendor B on this purchase (23.77%) is above the allowed threshold of 15%. However, it seems there is a justification for the discount (Special promotion applied) as per the provided data. But since the justification does not meet the policy's requirement (i.e., it does not specify that the justification comes from the vendor and has internal approval), this transaction violates the policy. Additionally, it would be beneficial to monitor future transactions from Vendor B to ensure compliance with the discount policy."
T187,15-07-24,9027.05,Vendor G,PO1166,Invoice,14.97%,,Yes,23-07-24,No,Projector,Yes," Based on the provided policy and transaction details, this transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of 9027.05 AED exceeds the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department (as per point 1 in the policy). However, it has Prior_Finance_Approval marked as 'Yes', so this constraint seems to have been followed.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage on this transaction is above 15%, which is 14.97%. According to point 5 in the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification (Discount_Justification field should not be empty). Since there's no justification provided in this transaction, it violates the Discounts policy constraint."
T188,18-09-24,10450.77,Vendor B,PO1157,Purchase,18.30%,Special promotion applied,Yes,12-10-24,No,Printer Supplies,Yes," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) because the amount of the purchase (AED 10450.77) exceeds the maximum limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (AED 10,000). Additionally, although the transaction does have Prior_Finance_Approval, it should be noted that the policy requires this only when the amount is above AED 10,000. Since Vendor B is not listed as a Procurement Approved Vendor (Vendor A, C, E, G, or I), it also violates constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions)."

The violation is in regards to the Discounts section (Policy Point 5). In this case, the discount percentage (19.86%) exceeds the permitted limit of 15%. However, there is also a justification provided for the discount (""Special promotion applied""). To fully comply with the policy, it would be necessary to ensure that such transactions are either approved internally or that the justification meets the company's requirements and standards. Additionally, since the vendor (Vendor B) is not listed as an approved vendor under Procurement Approved Vendors, it is also in violation of the Vendor Restrictions section (Policy Point 3)."
T191,19-07-24,13100.92,Vendor I,PO1067,Invoice,24.04%,Special promotion applied,Yes,30-07-24,No,IT Equipment,Yes," Yes, the transaction appears to violate multiple policy constraints. Here's a breakdown:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from finance for a single transaction (Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000).

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted later than 30 days from the purchase date (Invoices must be submitted within 30 days of the purchase date).

3. Discounts: The discount applied is above the allowed limit without proper justification (Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval).

4. Vendor Restrictions: While Vendor I is listed as a procurement approved vendor, it's important to note that there might be other restrictions or requirements related to specific purchases or departments that are not provided in the given information. Nevertheless, it would be advisable to verify this with the procurement department.

5. Tax Compliance: This transaction meets the tax compliance requirement (All purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt). However, it's essential to ensure that the tax details are correctly documented and meet the necessary requirements for future audits.

In summary, the transaction violates policies related to Maximum Purchase Limit, Invoice Submission Deadline, and Discounts. It's important to verify the vendor restrictions and consult with the relevant departments (procurement and finance) to ensure compliance with company policies."
T192,07-09-24,2972.3,Vendor H,PO1084,Invoice,7.88%,,No,18-09-24,No,IT Equipment,Yes," Yes, the transaction appears to violate policy constraint 3 (Vendor Restrictions). The transaction was made with Vendor H, which is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor (Vendor A, C, E, G, I) in the provided list. Therefore, this purchase should have been pre-approved by the procurement department beforehand, but it seems that it wasn't, making the transaction non-compliant with the policy."

The transaction has a discount of 15.59%, which exceeds the allowed limit of 15% set in the policy. Additionally, the justification for the discount was not included in the transaction data provided. This violation necessitates internal approval and vendor justification before being considered compliant with the policy."
T195,18-09-24,13421.43,Vendor C,PO1557,Invoice,20.88%,Special promotion applied,Yes,20-09-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,Yes," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T195 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here's a breakdown of why it complies with each constraint:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount (AED 13,421.43) is less than AED 10,000 for a single transaction, so no approval from the finance department is required.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (20-09-24 > 18-09-24 + 30 days).

3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor C is one of the procurement approved vendors, which is acceptable.

4. Multiple Purchases: This transaction doesn't specify multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so it complies with this constraint.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (20.88%) is above the threshold of 15%, but there is a justification provided for the discount (""Special promotion applied"").

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as specified by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount (AED 13,421.43) is less than AED 5,000, so no department head authorization is required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: This transaction does not specify a duplicate invoice, and there's no mention of the same purchase order being received more than once. Therefore, it complies with this constraint as well."
T196,05-10-24,8293.61,Vendor H,PO1894,Invoice,12.67%,,Yes,16-10-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions). The vendor, Vendor H, is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor. According to the policy document, purchases can only be made from vendors who are pre-approved by the procurement department."
T197,06-07-24,7525.31,Vendor F,PO1109,Purchase,7.29%,,Yes,26-07-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T197 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of why this is the case:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 7,525.31) is less than AED 10,000, so no prior approval from the finance department is required.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (26-07-24) falls within the 30-day deadline for invoice submission.

3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor F is not listed as a procurement approved vendor, but the policy does not specify penalties for purchasing from unapproved vendors, only that such purchases cannot occur. In this case, it is assumed that exceptions may be made in certain situations or cases where the vendor has been added to the approved list retroactively.

4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction represents a single purchase of AED 7,525.31. Since there are no other transactions within a 7-day period for the same item, this constraint is not violated.

5. Discounts: The discount (7.29%) is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification or internal approval is required.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as stated by ""Tax Paid: Yes.""

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount for this transaction is below AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There is no indication that a duplicate invoice has been received for this purchase order (PO1109).

In summary, the transaction T197 does not seem to violate any of the stated policy constraints. However, it's important to note that in real-world scenarios, there may be additional context or policies that could affect the interpretation of these transactions."
T198,07-09-24,12974.92,Vendor G,PO1287,Invoice,18.99%,Special promotion applied,Yes,27-09-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Discounts policy (policy point 5). The discount percentage in this transaction (18.99%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, there is a discount greater than 15%, but there is no mention of any justification in the provided data. Therefore, this transaction does not comply with the Discounts policy as specified."
T199,03-08-24,9431.16,Vendor B,PO1765,Purchase,7.24%,,No,13-08-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction details, this transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints, with the following exceptions:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Rule 3): Vendor B is not in the list of procurement approved vendors, which could potentially violate this rule if there was no prior approval from the procurement department for this vendor. However, without explicit information about any such approval, it's impossible to definitively say whether this violation has occurred.

2. Prior_Finance_Approval (Rule 1): The transaction amount is AED 9431.16, which exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior finance department approval. Since the field ""Prior_Finance_Approval"" in this transaction indicates 'No', it violates Rule 1.

3. Purchase Authorization (Rule 7): The transaction amount is more than AED 5,000 and the field ""Department_Authorization"" indicates 'Yes', so this rule appears to be followed.

4. Tax Compliance (Rule 6): The transaction shows that tax was not paid, which violates Rule 6 if the vendor is not tax-exempt, without further information about the vendor's tax status.

5. Maximum Purchase Limit (Rule 1): Although this limit applies to a single transaction, since there is no information about multiple transactions related to the same purchase order, it's difficult to determine whether this rule was violated in terms of multiple purchases within a 7-day period.

In summary, based on the provided policy and transaction details, the transaction likely violates Rules 1, 6, and possibly Rule 3 (depending on vendor approval). However, without explicit information about some of these factors, it's impossible to definitively say whether all constraints have been violated."
T200,18-09-24,10778.35,Vendor H,PO1818,Invoice,4.05%,,No,09-10-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 as the amount exceeds AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, since Vendor H is not listed in the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I), it also violates policy constraint number 3."
T201,06-08-24,6190.29,Vendor C,PO1769,Invoice,15.35%,Special promotion applied,No,07-09-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 6,190.29, which is less than the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (07-09-24 - 06-08-24 = 25 days, which is less than 30).

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor C, is one of the procurement approved vendors (Vendor C is in the list of Procurement Approved Vendors).

4. Multiple Purchases: There is no information provided about any previous transactions within a 7-day period for comparison. However, this transaction does not exceed AED 20,000 in total (only AED 6,190.29 was purchased).

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (15.35%) is above 15% of the original price, but there is a justification provided (Special promotion applied) as required by the policy.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments since 'Tax Paid' is listed as 'No'. However, this doesn't violate the policy because vendors who are tax-exempt are allowed.

7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is less than AED 5,000, so no department head authorization is required (Department_Authorization: Yes means that the amount exceeds AED 5,000).

8. Duplicate Invoices: No information is provided about any duplicate invoices for this purchase order (Purchase Order ID: PO1769).

Therefore, the answer is 'No', this transaction does not violate any of the stated policy constraints."
T202,01-10-24,3681.98,Vendor H,PO1024,Purchase,21.94%,,No,05-10-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions). The vendor specified in this transaction, Vendor H, is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, Vendor I). Therefore, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department."
T203,22-09-24,6236.75,Vendor I,PO1123,Purchase,14.46%,,No,02-10-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the following transaction does violate a policy constraint:

Transaction ID: T203
Date: 22-09-24
Amount: 6236.75
Vendor: Vendor I
Purchase Order ID: PO1123
Type: Purchase
Discount: 14.46%
Discount_Justification: (empty)
Tax Paid: No
Submitted Date: 02-10-24
Department_Authorization: Yes
Item Description: Software Subscription
Prior_Finance_Approval: No

The policy violation is related to the ""Discounts"" and ""Prior_Finance_Approval"" sections of the policy:

1. Discounts: Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the transaction has a discount greater than 15% (14.46%) but there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field.

2. Prior_Finance_Approval: Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. The transaction amount of 6236.75 does not exceed AED 10,000, but the absence of 'Yes' in the Prior_Finance_Approval field suggests that the purchase did not receive prior finance department approval if it exceeded AED 10,000.

Therefore, the transaction violates policy constraints for both the ""Discounts"" and ""Prior_Finance_Approval"" sections."
T204,03-08-24,11780.58,Vendor D,PO1384,Purchase,20.25%,Special promotion applied,Yes,21-08-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount of the transaction (AED 11,780.58) exceeds the maximum single transaction limit without prior approval from the finance department, which is AED 10,000 according to policy point 1.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage on this transaction (20.25%) is above the 15% threshold mentioned in policy point 5. Furthermore, the justification for the discount was not included in the provided data, which is a requirement according to the policy."

1. Vendor Restrictions (3): The vendor, Vendor B, is not in the list of procurement-approved vendors, which includes only Vendor A, C, E, G, and I.

2. Discounts (5): The discount percentage (23.39%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. Additionally, the transaction does not provide any justification for the high discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field as required by the policy."
T206,21-09-24,9581.5,Vendor G,PO1097,Invoice,6.52%,,No,21-09-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 7 (Purchase Authorization) and number 10 (Prior Finance Approval). The transaction amount of AED 9581.5 exceeds AED 5,000 but there is no confirmation of department authorization in the data provided. Additionally, since the amount exceeds AED 10,000, prior finance approval should have been obtained according to policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit)."
T207,31-08-24,4120.35,Vendor F,PO1419,Purchase,5.69%,,Yes,27-09-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction details, this transaction does not violate any of the policy constraints. Here are some reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 4,120.35) is less than AED 10,000, so it doesn't require prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (27-09-24 is within 30 days from 31-08-24).

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor F) is not listed as a procurement approved vendor, but since no such restriction was specified for server maintenance purchases, this transaction does not violate the policy in this regard.

4. Multiple Purchases: This is the first purchase of this item within a 7-day period, so it doesn't exceed AED 20,000 in total.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (5.69%) is below 15%, so no justification is required.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments (Tax Paid: Yes).

7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (AED 4,120.35) is less than AED 5,000, so it doesn't require authorization from the department head.

8. Duplicate Invoices: Since no duplicate invoice has been mentioned for this purchase order (PO1419), this transaction does not violate the policy in this regard.

So, 'No', the transaction does not violate any of the specified policy constraints."

The reason is that the discount percentage (17.02%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% without proper justification, as stated in point 5 of the Purchase Policy Document."
T209,01-08-24,8313.6,Vendor G,PO1020,Purchase,23.40%,Special promotion applied,No,17-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints for two reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount on this transaction (23.40%) is above the allowed limit of 15%. According to the Purchase Policy Document, any invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, there is no justification provided for the high discount.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments since 'Tax Paid' field shows 'No'. However, according to the policy, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Since no information about tax-exemption is provided for Vendor G in this example, it appears that the transaction violates the tax compliance policy as well."
T210,25-09-24,2592.41,Vendor D,PO1952,Invoice,14.17%,,Yes,02-10-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a breakdown:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount (2592.41 AED) is less than the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor D) is not listed among the procurement-approved vendors. However, this violation only applies if purchases are made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department. Since no such list is provided in this example, it's impossible to determine if this is a valid vendor or not.
4. Multiple Purchases: No information is given about previous transactions involving the same item, so it's unclear if this transaction violates the multiple purchases constraint.
5. Discounts: The discount (14.17%) is below the 15% threshold requiring justification, and there is no discount justification provided in the transaction data.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment details (Tax Paid: Yes), so it complies with this policy.
7. Purchase Authorization: The amount (2592.41 AED) is less than 5,000 AED, so authorization from the department head is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices are mentioned for this transaction.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the transaction does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. However, it's important to note that the vendor restriction may still apply if Vendor D is not a procurement-approved vendor. Without more context or information about approved vendors, it's impossible to confirm compliance in this specific case."
T211,26-07-24,10270.4,Vendor D,PO1829,Invoice,12.23%,,Yes,28-08-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit). The transaction amount is AED 10270.4 which exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 stated in the policy without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it does not seem that this purchase was made from a procurement-approved vendor (Vendor D is not listed in the Procurement Approved Vendors section)."
T212,03-07-24,12697.14,Vendor C,PO1118,Invoice,10.56%,,No,16-07-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 12,697.14 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as stated in the policy. The field 'Tax Paid' indicates that no tax was paid, but all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt according to the policy. Since there is no information provided about the vendor being tax-exempt, this transaction violates the tax compliance policy."
T213,31-08-24,14550.44,Vendor A,PO1964,Invoice,4.87%,,Yes,04-10-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 as the amount (AED 14550.44) exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it does not seem that there is any Department_Authorization if the amount is more than AED 5,000 as indicated by 'No' in the provided data."
T214,03-10-24,12292.13,Vendor I,PO1727,Purchase,23.13%,Special promotion applied,No,01-11-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Discounts policy (Point 5). According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, in this case, the transaction has a discount of 23.13%, which is more than 15% of the original amount, but there is no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. Therefore, the transaction does not comply with the stated policy."
T215,19-09-24,13532.56,Vendor G,PO1620,Invoice,20.52%,,No,20-10-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage for this transaction (20.52%) is above the allowed limit of 15%. This is in violation of the ""Discounts"" policy in point 5. No justification was provided for the high discount, which is also a requirement as per the policy.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments (Tax Paid: No), which goes against the ""Tax Compliance"" policy stated in point 6. Transactions missing tax details are flagged, and this transaction fits that description."
T216,08-10-24,13378.33,Vendor B,PO1909,Invoice,4.91%,,No,21-10-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Maximum Purchase Limit (Policy 1). The transaction amount of AED 13,378.33 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. This is not covered by the prior finance approval in this case (Prior_Finance_Approval: No)."
T217,26-09-24,14967.28,Vendor G,PO1159,Purchase,2.22%,,No,06-10-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints.

T218,12-09-24,14196.05,Vendor B,PO1099,Invoice,6.72%,,Yes,27-09-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (""Maximum Purchase Limit""). The transaction amount of AED 14,196.05 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

The transaction is made with a vendor (Vendor D) that is not listed as pre-approved by the procurement department in the Procurement Approved Vendors list provided. Additionally, the discount percentage on this invoice (13.66%) exceeds the 15% limit set in Policy Constraint number 5 without any justification provided for the discount."
T220,22-09-24,12897.73,Vendor A,PO1049,Invoice,24.60%,Special promotion applied,Yes,25-10-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 - Discounts. The discount provided in this transaction (24.60%) exceeds the maximum allowed without justification as per the policy, which is 15%. Even though there is a justification provided for the discount (""Special promotion applied""), it should have been submitted and approved prior to the purchase, according to the policy. The internal approval would then need to justify why the discount exceeded the limit set in the policy."

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor F, is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor (Vendor A, C, E, G, I).
2. Discounts: The discount given in this transaction is 22.12%, which exceeds the policy limit of 15%. However, there is a justification provided for the discount, but it still requires internal approval as per the policy.
3. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction amount is AED 7,211.08 and exceeds the policy limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (Prior_Finance_Approval field shows 'No')."

It violates the Discounts policy (point 5 in the Purchase Policy Document). The discount given in this transaction is 21.41%, which is above the allowed maximum of 15% without justification. Therefore, it needs to include a justification from the vendor and internal approval, but in this case, there's no such justification provided."

2. Discounts: The discount on this transaction is 22.74%, which is more than 15% of the original price and there is no justification provided for the discount. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval.
3. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is AED 14683.63 which exceeds AED 5,000 and requires authorization from the department head. However, there is no 'Department_Authorization' field indicating that the authorization has been obtained."

The violation is related to Discounts (Policy 5). In this case, the discount percentage (13.92%) exceeds the permitted limit of 15%. However, there is no justification provided for the discount in the transaction data fields (Discount_Justification). Therefore, it should be flagged for review and require internal approval."
T226,16-07-24,2510.94,Vendor D,PO1468,Invoice,5.67%,,Yes,16-07-24,No,Software Subscription,No," No, the transaction does not violate any of the given policy constraints at first glance. Here's a quick breakdown of how it checks against each policy point:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount (AED 2510.94) is below AED 10,000, so prior approval from the finance department is not required.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted on the same day as the transaction, which is within the 30 days deadline.
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor D is not listed among the procurement approved vendors, but this specific transaction does not violate the policy since no purchases were made in this case.
4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction doesn't involve multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period, so it doesn't exceed AED 20,000.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (5.67%) is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification or internal approval is required.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is less than AED 5,000, so authorization from the department head is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: Since this is the only invoice for PO1468, no duplicate invoices are allowed in this case."
T227,27-07-24,4835.03,Vendor I,PO1823,Invoice,24.56%,,Yes,31-07-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage provided for this transaction (24.56%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. According to policy number 5, invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, no justification is provided.

2. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount (4835.03 AED) exceeds the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval (10,000 AED), as stated in policy number 1. The field 'Prior_Finance_Approval' is marked as 'No', which suggests that no such approval was given.

It is important to note that these violations could lead to the transaction being flagged for review and may require further action, such as correcting the issues or seeking necessary approvals."
T228,18-07-24,10079.76,Vendor G,PO1325,Purchase,9.31%,,Yes,20-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1: Maximum Purchase Limit. The transaction amount of AED 10079.76 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 mentioned in the policy without prior approval from the finance department. Even though the vendor (Vendor G) is approved, and other details seem to be in compliance with the policy, this particular transaction should have had prior approval due to its value."
T229,09-09-24,13740.33,Vendor B,PO1904,Invoice,9.03%,,No,16-09-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount of AED 13,740.33 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.
2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as indicated by 'No' under the 'Tax Paid' field, which violates policy constraint number 6.
3. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction does not have prior finance department approval for purchases exceeding AED 10,000, as indicated by 'No' under the 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field.
4. Department_Authorization: The transaction amount is more than AED 5,000 and does not have authorization from the department head, as indicated by 'No' under the 'Department_Authorization' field."
T230,27-09-24,9602.43,Vendor B,PO1329,Purchase,21.53%,Special promotion applied,Yes,11-10-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Rule 3): The transaction was made from vendor B, who is not in the list of procurement approved vendors. Only purchases can be made from vendors who are pre-approved by the procurement department.

2. Discounts (Rule 5): The discount percentage on this invoice (21.53%) exceeds the allowable limit of 15%. Invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval, but in this case, no such justification is provided."
T231,24-07-24,11575.25,Vendor B,PO1928,Invoice,19.31%,Special promotion applied,Yes,05-08-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.
2. Discounts: The invoice has a discount of more than 15% (19.31%) and does not include justification from the vendor and internal approval."
T232,29-09-24,8356.49,Vendor H,PO1903,Purchase,17.44%,Special promotion applied,Yes,29-09-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints.

1. Vendor Restrictions (Rule 3) - The vendor for this transaction is not on the list of procurement-approved vendors, which are Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, and Vendor I. Since Vendor H is not in the approved list, the purchase made from this vendor violates the policy.

2. Discounts (Rule 5) - The discount percentage for this transaction is above 15%, which is 17.44%. However, there's no justification provided for the discount, as per Rule 5. Since the discount doesn't have a valid justification and exceeds the allowed limit without internal approval, the transaction violates the policy.

It is essential to note that these two violations are not cumulative; even one violation would make the transaction non-compliant with the Purchase Policy."
T233,22-08-24,13403.12,Vendor F,PO1879,Invoice,8.39%,,Yes,11-09-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No,No violation
T234,14-08-24,5765.41,Vendor D,PO1563,Purchase,4.04%,,Yes,17-09-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T234 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are the reasons for each constraint:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 5765.41 which is below AED 10,000, so no prior approval from the finance department is required.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date for this transaction is within 30 days of the purchase date (assuming the date format is dd-mm-yy), so it meets the submission deadline.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor D, is not listed as a procurement approved vendor. However, since there is no information about prior approval from the procurement department, we cannot confirm whether this constraint is violated or not.
4. Multiple Purchases: This transaction does not involve multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period, so it meets the multiple purchase constraint.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage for this transaction (4.04%) is below the threshold of 15%, so no justification or internal approval is required.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment details (Tax Paid: Yes), so it meets the tax compliance constraint.
7. Purchase Authorization: The department authorization for this transaction is 'Yes', indicating that the amount is above AED 5,000 and has been authorized by the department head.
8. Duplicate Invoices: This transaction does not appear to have any duplicate invoices for the same purchase order, so it meets the duplicate invoice constraint.

In summary, based on the information provided, transaction T234 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints."
T235,02-09-24,12471.48,Vendor E,PO1440,Invoice,20.72%,,No,10-09-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraints for multiple reasons:

1. The amount of the transaction (AED 12471.48) exceeds AED 10,000, which requires prior approval from the finance department. However, Prior_Finance_Approval field shows 'No'.

2. The discount percentage given in the invoice (20.72%) is above 15%, but there is no justification for the discount provided in the Discount_Justification field. According to policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

3. The Tax Paid field shows 'No', whereas all purchases should include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Transactions missing tax details will be flagged, as in this case.

These violations warrant further review to ensure compliance with the organization's Purchase Policy Document."
T236,20-07-24,3576.48,Vendor E,PO1356,Purchase,23.23%,Special promotion applied,Yes,14-08-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of why:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount of AED 3576.48 is below the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 and does not require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission deadline is 30 days from the purchase date, and in this case, it has been submitted within that time frame (from 24-07-20 to 14-08-24 is less than 30 days).
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor E, is listed among the procurement approved vendors.
4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about previous purchases from this vendor in the given transaction data. However, if there were multiple purchases within a 7-day period exceeding AED 20,000, it would violate the policy.
5. Discounts: The discount of 23.23% is more than 15%, but the invoice includes justification from the vendor (Special promotion applied) and internal approval (Department_Authorization: Yes).
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments (Tax Paid: Yes), as required by policy.
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is below AED 5,000, so no department head authorization is needed.
8. Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices have been mentioned in the given data, so this constraint is not violated."
T237,12-10-24,10550.06,Vendor B,PO1343,Purchase,1.19%,,Yes,07-11-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 - Maximum Purchase Limit. The amount of the purchase in this transaction is AED 10,550.06, which exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Therefore, it should not have been allowed unless prior approval was obtained."
T238,15-10-24,13326.2,Vendor E,PO1630,Invoice,8.82%,,No,12-11-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 13,326.2 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (as per point 1 in the policy).

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments, but according to point 6 in the policy, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Since the ""Tax Paid"" field shows ""No"", this transaction violates the tax compliance policy."
T239,11-10-24,11474.97,Vendor C,PO1218,Purchase,15.25%,Special promotion applied,Yes,11-10-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in point number 5 of the Purchase Policy Document. In this transaction, the Discount percentage (15.25%) is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, since there is no justification provided, the transaction violates the stated policy."
T240,20-07-24,4232.5,Vendor H,PO1151,Purchase,4.05%,,No,15-08-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No,No violation
T241,18-08-24,13050.42,Vendor H,PO1313,Invoice,5.19%,,Yes,23-08-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. Specifically, it violates constraint 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) as the amount of AED 13,050.42 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, there is no record of Prior_Finance_Approval in this case."
T242,24-09-24,6796.22,Vendor E,PO1118,Invoice,16.06%,Special promotion applied,No,02-10-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The policy states in point 5 that ""Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval."" In this case, the transaction has a discount of 16.06%, which is above the 15% threshold set by the policy. Additionally, there is no mention of internal approval for this transaction. Therefore, it violates both conditions specified in point 5 of the Purchase Policy Document."
T243,10-10-24,4009.58,Vendor A,PO1203,Purchase,4.90%,,No,04-11-24,No,Office Computers,No,No violation
T244,24-08-24,14593.49,Vendor B,PO1637,Purchase,12.26%,,No,05-09-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 14,593.49) exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction does not have prior finance department approval even though it exceeds the specified amount (AED 10,000). This is in violation of policy constraint number 1 and 7.

In addition, it's worth noting that the vendor (Vendor B) is not listed as a procurement approved vendor, which violates policy constraint number 3. However, this might be a missing data issue in the provided transaction details rather than an actual violation since Vendor B is not listed among the procurement approved vendors.

Regarding other policy constraints, the transaction does not appear to violate them based on the information provided, but it's important to note that the invoice submission deadline, vendor restrictions, multiple purchases within a 7-day period, discount justification, tax compliance, and duplicate invoices might be impacted by missing or incorrect data in the transactions.csv file."
T245,27-09-24,12515.74,Vendor D,PO1586,Invoice,7.88%,,No,29-10-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit). The transaction amount of AED 12,515.74 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department as stated in the policy. Additionally, it does not comply with constraint number 7 (Purchase Authorization) because there is no Department_Authorization for a transaction above AED 5,000."
T246,06-07-24,2885.73,Vendor F,PO1836,Purchase,3.58%,,No,08-08-24,Yes,Projector,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction details, the transaction T246 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of why:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 2885.73) is below AED 10,000, so it doesn't require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date for this transaction (08-08-24) is within 30 days of the purchase date (06-07-24), meeting the submission deadline requirement.
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor F is not listed among the procurement approved vendors, but since there are no explicit details about prior approval for this vendor, it's unclear if a violation has occurred.
4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction doesn't include any other related purchases within a 7-day period, so this constraint is not applicable.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage provided (3.58%) is below the threshold of 15%, and there is no need for justification or internal approval in this case.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments since ""Tax Paid"" is marked as No, but this seems to be in compliance as the vendor is not tax-exempt according to the policy.
7. Purchase Authorization: The department head authorization (Yes) is provided for this transaction, and the amount (AED 2885.73) is below AED 5,000, so it doesn't require authorization from the department head according to the policy.
8. Duplicate Invoices: The transaction does not have any duplicate invoices for the same purchase order, meeting this requirement.

In conclusion, the transaction T246 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints based on the provided information."
T247,16-08-24,6275.11,Vendor G,PO1152,Invoice,24.52%,,No,11-09-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 ""Discounts"". The transaction has a discount of 24.52%, which is more than 15% of the original price (as calculated from the Amount field), but there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field as required by the policy. Therefore, the invoice does not comply with the stated policy."
T248,11-10-24,9628.85,Vendor C,PO1371,Invoice,14.46%,,No,29-10-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to the Discounts section of the policy (Point 5). In this case, the discount provided (14.46%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% without providing justification (Discount_Justification field is empty). Therefore, the invoice requires a justification from the vendor and internal approval according to the policy."
T249,16-07-24,4133.31,Vendor H,PO1392,Purchase,15.76%,Special promotion applied,No,21-07-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Based on the given policy, the transaction T249 violates two policies:

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor 'Vendor H' is not listed as a Procurement Approved Vendor (Purchase Policy Document, section 3).

2. Discounts: Although the discount percentage is within the allowed limit of 15%, there is no justification provided for the discount in the transaction data (transaction file data fields, 'Discount_Justification' field is not empty but does not meet the requirement as it only states ""Special promotion applied"", Purchase Policy Document, section 5).

Therefore, the answer is 'Yes', the transaction T249 violates policy constraints."
T250,19-07-24,2554.1,Vendor C,PO1637,Purchase,2.94%,,No,02-08-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No,No violation
T251,03-10-24,13110.54,Vendor E,PO1807,Invoice,15.30%,Special promotion applied,Yes,18-10-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5, ""Discounts"". The invoice with a discount of 15.30% exceeds the allowed maximum of a 15% discount as stated in the policy. Additionally, since prior finance department approval was not provided for a purchase amount over AED 10,000 (as per policy constraint number 4, ""Prior Finance Department Approval""), this transaction also violates that constraint."
T252,06-08-24,11633.56,Vendor C,PO1541,Purchase,24.66%,Special promotion applied,Yes,14-08-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts). The discount provided by Vendor C is 24.66%, which exceeds the allowed maximum of 15% specified in the policy. Therefore, an additional justification beyond a ""special promotion"" was required for this discount."
T253,14-10-24,3990.76,Vendor A,PO1317,Purchase,20.36%,Special promotion applied,No,01-11-24,No,Server Maintenance,No,No violation
T254,08-08-24,9113.19,Vendor H,PO1505,Purchase,22.56%,,No,11-08-24,Yes,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Policy 3): The vendor, Vendor H, is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor.
2. Discounts (Policy 5): The discount provided by the vendor is 22.56%, which exceeds the policy limit of 15% without justification."
T255,01-10-24,3974.34,Vendor F,PO1050,Invoice,7.99%,,Yes,04-10-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction violates one policy constraint. The violation is in point 3 of the Purchase Policy Document, Vendor Restrictions. In this case, the transaction was made with a vendor (Vendor F) that is not pre-approved by the procurement department. Only vendors listed as Procurement Approved Vendors (Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, and Vendor I) are allowed for purchases according to this policy."
T256,05-10-24,10810.94,Vendor I,PO1273,Purchase,24.24%,,No,11-10-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount of the purchase (AED 10,810.94) exceeds the single transaction limit without prior approval from the finance department (which is AED 10,000).

2. Discounts: The discount percentage (24.24%) on the invoice is above the allowed limit of 15% without a justification provided. This violates policy constraint 5."
T257,16-07-24,13679.38,Vendor A,PO1224,Invoice,15.02%,Special promotion applied,Yes,21-07-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Maximum Purchase Limit (Policy 1) and Purchase Authorization (Policy 7).

Firstly, the purchase amount of AED 13,679.38 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (Policy 1). Although the transaction has Department_Authorization set to 'Yes' for an amount greater than AED 5,000, it does not meet the requirement that purchases over AED 10,000 must have Prior_Finance_Approval set to 'Yes'.

Secondly, while the department head authorized the transaction (Policy 7), the policy states that purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head. However, for a purchase exceeding AED 10,000, approval from both the department head and the finance department is required. In this case, only Department_Authorization is present, which means the transaction violates Policy 7 as well."
T258,07-10-24,13823.45,Vendor F,PO1689,Invoice,16.44%,Special promotion applied,No,15-10-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints for the following reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 13,823.45 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction).

2. Discounts: The invoice has a discount of 16.44%, which is above the allowed limit of 15% of the original price without proper justification from the vendor and internal approval (Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval).

3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction was made with Vendor F, which is not listed as one of the procurement approved vendors (Purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department).

As a result, this transaction violates three policy constraints."
T259,08-09-24,4388.5,Vendor B,PO1903,Invoice,21.84%,,Yes,19-09-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to Discounts (Policy point 5). In this transaction, the discount percentage exceeds 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the discount (Discount_Justification field in the transactions.csv file is empty). According to the Purchase Policy Document, all invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, neither the justification nor the internal approval has been provided."
T260,20-07-24,4414.43,Vendor D,PO1235,Invoice,16.98%,Special promotion applied,Yes,26-07-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions) because the vendor, Vendor D, is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor in the provided list of approved vendors."
T261,03-07-24,9549.18,Vendor A,PO1163,Invoice,4.91%,,No,10-07-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T261 does not violate any policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 9549.18, which is less than AED 10,000 and doesn't require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (as it happened on 03-07-24 and was submitted on 10-07-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor A, is a procurement-approved vendor.
4. Multiple Purchases: This transaction doesn't involve multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period, so it doesn't violate this policy.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage on this invoice (4.91%) is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification is needed.
6. Tax Compliance: Although tax was not paid in this transaction, it is allowed since the vendor is not tax-exempt.
7. Purchase Authorization: The department head authorization is provided for this transaction (Yes).
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about duplicate invoices in this case. However, if this were a duplicate invoice, it would be flagged as per the policy."
T262,03-10-24,13111.82,Vendor E,PO1812,Purchase,17.11%,Special promotion applied,Yes,05-11-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5, Discounts. The discount provided by Vendor E is 17.11%, which exceeds the allowed maximum of 15%. However, there seems to be a justification given in the Discount_Justification field (Special promotion applied), but according to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% require not only a justification from the vendor, but also internal approval. Since no internal approval is mentioned in this case, it violates the policy."
T263,08-07-24,10358.52,Vendor D,PO1490,Invoice,8.14%,,Yes,12-07-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 as the purchase amount of AED 10358.52 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, since there is no entry for 'Prior_Finance_Approval' in this transaction and it is more than AED 10,000, that also indicates a violation of the policy."
T264,02-09-24,4099.65,Vendor B,PO1189,Invoice,24.24%,Special promotion applied,Yes,01-10-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (""Discounts""). The discount (24.24%) given in this transaction is above the allowed limit of 15% of the original price (as per the policy). Therefore, an additional justification from the vendor and internal approval should have been included, but it appears that none was provided in this case."
T265,03-09-24,14346.11,Vendor B,PO1017,Invoice,22.66%,,No,05-10-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Policy 3): The vendor, Vendor B, is not on the list of procurement-approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). Therefore, purchases cannot be made from this vendor without prior approval.

2. Discounts (Policy 5): The discount percentage for this transaction is 22.66%, which exceeds the policy limit of 15%. However, there is no justification provided in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since this justification is missing, the transaction violates this policy as well."
T266,27-07-24,8076.34,Vendor G,PO1325,Invoice,2.94%,,Yes,29-08-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction appears to violate Policy Constraint number 5 (Discounts) because the discount percentage (2.94%) is greater than 15% of the original price and there is no justification provided for the discount in the Discount_Justification field. According to the policy, all invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the invoice lacks such justification."
T267,08-07-24,6804.29,Vendor C,PO1518,Purchase,12.14%,,No,26-07-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Discounts policy (point 5). The discount on this transaction is above 15% of the original price, which is 12.14%, but there is no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to the policy, all invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since this condition is not met, the transaction violates the policy."
T268,18-09-24,11765.06,Vendor D,PO1180,Invoice,6.15%,,No,21-10-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. Specifically, it violates the Maximum Purchase Limit policy as the amount of AED 11,765.06 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (as stated in Policy point 1). Additionally, the vendor ""Vendor D"" is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (as per policy point 3), which could also be considered a violation. However, it's important to note that this policy interpretation should be double-checked with the relevant department for final confirmation, as there might be additional factors or exceptions to consider in real-world scenarios."
T269,27-09-24,5443.82,Vendor G,PO1289,Purchase,11.44%,,No,04-10-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. Specifically, it violates the ""Discounts"" policy (point 5). The discount percentage of 11.44% is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the discount in the Discount_Justification field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since there's no such justification in this case, the transaction violates this policy requirement."
T270,07-08-24,2884.49,Vendor E,PO1318,Invoice,1.65%,,No,17-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. It violates the ""Purchase Limit"" policy (point 1) as the invoice amount of AED 2884.49 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit without prior approval from the finance department, which is AED 10,000 in this case. Additionally, it does not have the ""Department_Authorization"" field set to 'Yes' as the amount exceeds AED 5,000 and requires authorization from the department head."
T271,09-10-24,10018.25,Vendor C,PO1011,Purchase,7.66%,,No,13-11-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Maximum Purchase Limit (point 1 in the policy). The transaction amount of AED 10018.25 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. This rule is stated as ""Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department."" Since there's no record of Prior_Finance_Approval in this transaction, it violates this policy."
T272,11-08-24,5078.6,Vendor D,PO1273,Purchase,15.58%,Special promotion applied,No,06-09-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction appears to violate policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) and possibly constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions).

1. Discounts: Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. The transaction shows a discount of 15.58%, which exceeds the specified limit without any justification provided in the 'Discount_Justification' field.

2. Vendor Restrictions: Purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department. In this case, Vendor D is not listed among the Procurement Approved Vendors provided (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). Although the transaction shows Department Authorization (Yes), it doesn't mean that the vendor was pre-approved by the procurement department."
T273,31-07-24,10367.31,Vendor C,PO1272,Purchase,22.25%,Special promotion applied,Yes,27-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. The violation is in relation to the Maximum Purchase Limit (1) and Discounts (5) policies.

The transaction amount of AED 10367.31 exceeds the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department, which should not exceed AED 10,000 according to policy 1.

Additionally, the discount percentage on this invoice is 22.25%, which is more than the permitted 15% threshold as stated in policy 5. However, there is no justification for the large discount provided in the transaction data fields (Discount_Justification). As a result, the transaction should be flagged for review due to these two policy violations."
T274,26-08-24,12055.33,Vendor I,PO1142,Invoice,1.35%,,Yes,04-09-24,Yes,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Maximum Purchase Limit (Policy Point 1). The transaction amount of AED 12055.33 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Since the 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field in the transactions file is marked as 'No', it indicates that the necessary approval was not obtained before the transaction, leading to a violation of the policy."

The invoice has a discount of 24.76%, which is above 15% of the original price (since we don't know the original price, let's assume it as the amount provided, i.e., AED 3472.79). In this case, the invoice must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, there is no justification mentioned in the transaction data (Discount_Justification field), which makes it a violation of the policy."
T277,11-09-24,8529.23,Vendor H,PO1307,Purchase,12.91%,,Yes,06-10-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions) as Vendor H is not listed among the Procurement Approved Vendors (Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, Vendor I). Therefore, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department."

T280,26-07-24,6076.07,Vendor D,PO1364,Invoice,12.57%,,No,22-08-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions). The vendor ""Vendor D"" is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor in the provided list (Procurement Approved Vendors: Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, Vendor I). Therefore, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department."

T282,10-10-24,10461.4,Vendor A,PO1966,Invoice,11.87%,,No,19-10-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints as it exceeds the Maximum Purchase Limit set in point 1 of the policy. The transaction amount is AED 10461.4 which is above AED 10,000 and does not have prior approval from the finance department as indicated by ""Prior_Finance_Approval: No"". Therefore, it is necessary to obtain approval before making such a purchase."
T283,24-09-24,8792.37,Vendor G,PO1545,Purchase,13.59%,,No,23-10-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction with Transaction ID T283 violates two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 8792.37) exceeds AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (Prior_Finance_Approval is No).

2. Discounts: The discount percentage (13.59%) is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification for the discount provided in the Discount_Justification field.

So, the answer is 'Yes', the transaction violates policy constraints."
T284,28-07-24,2080.76,Vendor C,PO1282,Invoice,11.72%,,No,04-08-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No,No violation
T285,10-09-24,5746.18,Vendor B,PO1150,Purchase,16.28%,Special promotion applied,No,18-09-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Policy 3): The vendor, Vendor B, is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor.
2. Discounts (Policy 5): The discount on this purchase (16.28%) exceeds the permitted limit of 15%. Since there is no justification provided for this high discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, it violates policy.
3. Tax Compliance (Policy 6): The transaction does not include tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: No"". This violation can be addressed if the vendor is tax-exempt or if the missing tax details are corrected later. However, since no information about the vendor's tax status is provided in this scenario, we cannot confirm compliance with this policy.
4. Prior Finance Approval (Policy 7 & Policy 1): Although the purchase amount (AED 5746.18) is below AED 5,000 and does not require department head authorization, the transaction still needs prior finance approval because it exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without approval. Since no 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field indicates approval has been granted, this policy is violated."
T286,06-09-24,4486.08,Vendor F,PO1199,Invoice,9.66%,,No,03-10-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1) Vendor Restrictions (Policy 3): The vendor ""Vendor F"" is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor in the provided list (Procurement Approved Vendors).

2) Tax Compliance (Policy 6): The transaction does not include tax payments since ""Tax Paid: No"" is mentioned. However, according to policy 6, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. This transaction violates this constraint because it lacks tax details."
T287,12-07-24,6433.13,Vendor C,PO1745,Invoice,20.40%,Special promotion applied,Yes,13-07-24,Yes,Projector,No,No violation
T288,20-08-24,3876.83,Vendor G,PO1881,Invoice,10.92%,,No,01-09-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 6 (Tax Compliance) as the transaction does not include tax payments and the field ""Tax Paid"" is marked as 'No'. According to the policy, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. In this case, since no tax details are provided, the transaction is flagged."
T289,27-09-24,3023.66,Vendor C,PO1025,Purchase,1.61%,,Yes,16-10-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction does not appear to violate any of the policy constraints directly. Here is a breakdown of the comparison:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (3023.66 AED) is below the limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (16-10-24) falls within the allowed deadline of 30 days from the purchase date.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor C) is among the Procurement Approved Vendors.
4. Multiple Purchases: This transaction does not involve multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period, so we cannot compare it to this policy constraint.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (1.61%) is less than 15%, so no justification is required.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment details with ""Yes"" in the Tax Paid field.
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount does not exceed AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: We have no information about duplicate invoices for this transaction.

However, it's worth noting that this transaction may still violate other unspecified or implicit policies not mentioned in the provided policy document. For example, if there are internal approval requirements for consulting services purchases, or if there is a policy against making small transactions without department head authorization. It's essential to have a thorough understanding of all relevant policies and guidelines to ensure compliance."
T290,09-08-24,2699.92,Vendor F,PO1735,Invoice,17.66%,Special promotion applied,Yes,31-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. The violation is in the Discounts section of the policy. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the discount (17.66%) exceeds the allowed limit (15%) and there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field. Therefore, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5."
T291,26-08-24,14409.27,Vendor D,PO1298,Purchase,4.97%,,Yes,30-09-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) because the amount of AED 14,409.27 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department."
T292,12-07-24,5246.71,Vendor A,PO1153,Invoice,18.58%,Special promotion applied,No,13-08-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 - Discounts. The transaction has a discount of 18.58%, which is above the allowed 15% limit as stated in the policy. However, it does not include justification from the vendor or internal approval, which is required for such discounts according to the policy."
T293,12-07-24,10553.08,Vendor C,PO1542,Purchase,19.09%,Special promotion applied,Yes,16-08-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T293 does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Maximum Purchase Limit policy (Point 1) as the transaction amount of AED 10553.08 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Although there is a department authorization (Yes), it doesn't provide prior financial approval, which is required when the transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000."
T294,14-10-24,11304.85,Vendor A,PO1201,Purchase,16.03%,Special promotion applied,Yes,16-11-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in point 5 of the Purchase Policy Document which states that Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the discount (16.03%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%, but there is no mention of any justification from the vendor or internal approval in the provided transaction data. Therefore, it violates policy number 5."
T295,06-07-24,12839.84,Vendor H,PO1394,Invoice,20.01%,Special promotion applied,No,28-07-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraints for the following reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of 12839.84 AED exceeds the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department (Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval).

2. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor ""Vendor H"" is not on the list of procurement approved vendors (Purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department).

3. Discounts: The discount given in this transaction (20.01%) exceeds the threshold of 15% without a justification included (Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval).

4. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is more than AED 5,000 and no department head authorization has been provided (Purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head)."
T296,23-09-24,7746.1,Vendor D,PO1794,Purchase,16.08%,Special promotion applied,Yes,24-10-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions (3): The transaction was made with Vendor D, which is not in the list of pre-approved vendors (Procurement Approved Vendors).

2. Discounts (5): The invoice has a discount above 15% (16.08%) of the original price, but it does not include a justification from the vendor and internal approval as required by the policy."
T297,29-09-24,7327.19,Vendor H,PO1539,Purchase,7.62%,,No,02-10-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Based on the provided policy document, the transaction T297 does not appear to violate any of the listed policy constraints directly. However, there are a few concerns that should be addressed for compliance purposes:

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor ""Vendor H"" is not among the pre-approved vendors listed in the procurement approved vendors list (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). Therefore, the transaction might need to go through an approval process or be denied based on this constraint.
2. Purchase Authorization: Although the amount of the transaction is below AED 5,000, the department head authorization is indicated as ""Yes."" This raises a question since the policy states that purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head. However, this discrepancy might be due to human error in data entry and should be clarified to confirm compliance with the Purchase Policy Document.
3. Prior Finance Approval: The field ""Prior_Finance_Approval"" is showing ""No,"" but given that the purchase amount is over AED 10,000 (7,327.19 > 10,000), finance department approval should have been obtained prior to the transaction.
4. Tax Compliance: The transaction has ""Tax Paid"" indicated as ""No,"" which contradicts the policy stating that all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. If the vendor is not tax-exempt, this transaction might be flagged for review and may require further investigation or correction to ensure compliance with the policy.

In summary, while the transaction does not directly violate any specific policy constraint, it raises concerns related to vendor restrictions, purchase authorization, prior finance approval, and tax compliance that need to be addressed for proper adherence to the Purchase Policy Document."
T298,12-07-24,4826.52,Vendor D,PO1693,Purchase,24.75%,Special promotion applied,No,05-08-24,Yes,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The policy states that Discounts greater than 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval (Point 5). In this case, the discount is 24.75%, which exceeds the 15% threshold, but there is no justification provided in the 'Discount_Justification' field."
T299,01-07-24,6557.61,Vendor G,PO1247,Invoice,23.29%,Special promotion applied,No,12-07-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5. The discount percentage for this transaction (23.29%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. However, there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field, which is required according to the policy. Even though the Department Authorization was obtained and the purchase was made from an approved vendor (Vendor G), these factors do not mitigate the violation of the discount policy."
T300,17-09-24,3232.58,Vendor B,PO1830,Purchase,15.79%,Special promotion applied,No,13-10-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction with ID T300 does not violate any policy constraints directly. However, it is important to note a few points:

1. The vendor (Vendor B) is not listed among the procurement-approved vendors, which goes against the Vendor Restrictions policy (point 3).
2. Although the discount percentage (15.79%) is above the threshold of 15%, there is a justification provided for it (""Special promotion applied""). However, it is not specified in the policy whether the justification must be in writing or provided at the time of purchase. Since we don't have that information, it remains unclear if this transaction violates point 5.
3. The department head authorization (Yes) suggests that the transaction amount exceeds AED 5,000, but there is no prior finance approval for a transaction over AED 10,000 (Prior_Finance_Approval: No). This could potentially violate point 7 if the transaction amount is indeed above AED 10,000.

Overall, it is recommended to double-check with the department head and procurement team regarding Vendor B's approval status and whether the discount justification and prior finance approval are in order before concluding that the transaction does not violate any policy constraints."
T301,25-09-24,2859.53,Vendor C,PO1411,Purchase,14.27%,,No,27-10-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates Policy Constraint number 5 - Discounts. The transaction has a discount of 14.27%, which is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, there is no justification provided."
T302,13-08-24,6359.09,Vendor F,PO1530,Purchase,23.42%,Special promotion applied,Yes,16-09-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5, ""Discounts"". The discount percentage of 23.42% is more than 15% of the original price, as stated in the policy. However, there is no justification for this large discount included in the transaction data, which is a requirement according to the policy. Therefore, the transaction should be flagged and reviewed due to the violation of the discounts policy."
T303,05-10-24,5625.04,Vendor A,PO1775,Purchase,19.33%,Special promotion applied,No,17-10-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction details, the transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (5625.04 AED) is below the single-transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (17-10-24) is within 30 days of the purchase date (05-10-24), so this constraint is met.

3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor A is included in the list of procurement approved vendors, so this constraint is not violated.

4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction does not involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so this constraint is not applicable to the given data.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (19.33%) is above the 15% threshold, but there is a justification provided for the discount (""Special promotion applied""), and invoices with such high discounts require vendor and internal approval, which seems to be present in this case (through the ""Discount_Justification"" field).

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction indicates that tax was not paid (Tax Paid: No), but this is allowed when the vendor is tax-exempt according to the policy.

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount (5625.04 AED) is below the 5,000 AED threshold requiring authorization from the department head, and Department_Authorization is ""Yes"".

8. Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices are involved in this transaction, so this constraint is not violated.

Therefore, the answer is 'No', the transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints based on the given data and policies provided."
T304,02-10-24,11554.22,Vendor G,PO1978,Invoice,0.39%,,No,01-11-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraints as follows:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 11,554.22) exceeds AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department.

Additionally, let's examine some other policy points for information:
- Purchase Authorization: Since the transaction amount is greater than AED 5,000, Department_Authorization should be 'Yes'. However, it is 'No'.
- Prior_Finance_Approval: Since the transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000, Prior_Finance_Approval should be 'Yes'. However, it is 'No'."
T305,08-10-24,5099.84,Vendor F,PO1194,Purchase,13.34%,,No,13-10-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint 3 (Vendor Restrictions). The transaction was made with Vendor F who is not listed as a pre-approved vendor in the Procurement Approved Vendors list provided."
T306,21-09-24,12136.68,Vendor I,PO1989,Purchase,12.79%,,No,16-10-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the specific violations:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 12,136.68 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: No"". This violates policy 6, which states that all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Transactions missing tax details will be flagged."
T307,31-08-24,5512.38,Vendor C,PO1506,Invoice,16.68%,Special promotion applied,No,05-10-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount on this invoice (16.68%) is above the 15% limit specified in the Purchase Policy Document. According to the policy, any discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, there is no mention of such justification or approval.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not comply with the tax compliance requirement as it states that all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. However, in this case, the transaction was marked as ""No"" for tax paid. This violates the policy."
T308,02-07-24,2650.56,Vendor E,PO1697,Invoice,0.61%,,Yes,10-07-24,No,Projector,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction with Transaction ID T308 does not appear to violate any of the explicitly stated policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of the comparison:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 2650.56) is below AED 10,000, and no prior finance approval was required since it's below the specified limit.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission deadline of 30 days has not been exceeded as the submitted date (10-07-24) is within this timeframe from the transaction date (02-07-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor E, is in the list of procurement approved vendors.
4. Multiple Purchases: This specific transaction does not involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so this constraint is not applicable here.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (0.61%) is less than 15%, so no justification is required for the discount.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (AED 2650.56) is below AED 5,000, so authorization from the department head was not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices are mentioned in this case.

However, it is essential to note that there might be additional policies or guidelines related to projector purchases, vendor relationships, or other factors not explicitly stated in the provided policy document. It's always important to consider all relevant policies when evaluating transactions for compliance purposes."
T309,02-08-24,2051.27,Vendor A,PO1515,Purchase,12.87%,,Yes,27-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction with Transaction ID T309 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here's a breakdown of how it aligns with each policy point:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is below AED 10,000, and no prior finance approval was required for this amount.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: Although the submission date provided (27-08-24) is later than the stated 30 days, it's unclear from the given information whether this transaction is an invoice or a purchase. If it's a purchase, the submission deadline may not be applicable.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor A, is on the list of procurement-approved vendors.
4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about any previous transactions within the last 7 days to compare against this limit.
5. Discounts: Although the discount percentage (12.87%) is above 0%, it's less than 15% of the original price, so there's no need for a justification or internal approval.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes.""
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is below AED 5,000, so department head authorization was not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about any duplicate invoices for this transaction.

The main issue with the given transaction is that the submission date seems to be later than the stated 30 days deadline, but more context or clarification on whether it's an invoice or purchase would be needed to definitively answer if there's a violation of any policy constraints."
T310,21-09-24,12152,Vendor G,PO1116,Invoice,18.51%,Special promotion applied,Yes,21-09-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the ""Discounts"" section of the Purchase Policy Document (Policy 5). In this transaction, the discount percentage is above 15% of the original price (18.51% > 15%) and there is no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since there is no justification mentioned in this transaction, it violates the policy constraint."
T311,11-08-24,6986.26,Vendor H,PO1755,Purchase,9.49%,,No,20-08-24,Yes,Projector,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T311 does violate policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) and number 7 (Purchase Authorization). Here is the explanation for each violation:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 6986.26, which exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Since there is no Prior_Finance_Approval field in the transaction data indicating that the purchase has been approved, this transaction violates policy constraint number 1.

2. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is AED 6986.26, which exceeds the AED 5,000 threshold requiring authorization from the department head. However, there is a Department_Authorization field in the transaction data that indicates ""Yes"", meaning the department head has authorized this purchase. Since this approval contradicts the policy constraint number 7 (Purchase Authorization), it is not clear if this transaction violates the policy or not without further investigation.

In summary, based on the information provided, transaction T311 may or may not violate policy constraints depending on whether the department head's authorization was properly granted for a purchase above AED 5,000. Further investigation is needed to clarify this potential discrepancy."
T312,20-08-24,8789.88,Vendor A,PO1632,Purchase,1.22%,,Yes,22-09-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction (T312) does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount is AED 8789.88 which is less than AED 10,000 for a single transaction. No prior approval from the finance department is required.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission date (22-09-24) is within 30 days of the purchase date (20-08-24), so it is within the allowed time frame.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction was made from a pre-approved vendor (Vendor A).

4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about previous purchases in the given data, so we can't confirm if this transaction violates the multiple purchases constraint. However, for this specific transaction, it doesn't exceed the limit of AED 20,000 within a 7-day period.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (1.22%) is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification is needed according to the policy.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment information, and the tax was paid (Tax Paid: Yes).

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount (AED 8789.88) is less than AED 5,000, so no authorization from the department head is required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about duplicate invoices in the given data, so we can't confirm if this transaction violates this constraint.

In conclusion, this specific transaction does not seem to violate any of the listed policy constraints based on the provided information."
T313,06-08-24,2730.5,Vendor G,PO1633,Invoice,12.07%,,No,16-08-24,Yes,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. Specifically, it violates policy number 1 - Maximum Purchase Limit. The Invoice amount (2730.5 AED) exceeds the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department, as stated in the policy document. Additionally, there is no Prior_Finance_Approval specified for this transaction."
T314,24-08-24,3105.84,Vendor F,PO1108,Invoice,20.41%,Special promotion applied,Yes,27-09-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) because the discount percentage (20.41%) is above 15% of the original price (3105.84 * 0.15 = 465.87 > 20.41%) and there is no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, as required by the policy. Additionally, since prior finance approval was not obtained for a transaction exceeding AED 10,000 (as per policy constraint number 1), it also violates that rule."
T315,03-07-24,7960.72,Vendor C,PO1396,Purchase,19.49%,Special promotion applied,Yes,05-08-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T315 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here's a breakdown of the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit (AED 10,000): The transaction amount is AED 7960.72, which is less than the specified limit.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date is within 30 days of the purchase date (we don't have a specific purchase date for this transaction). So, it can be assumed that the invoice was submitted on time.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor C) is listed as one of the procurement-approved vendors.
4. Multiple Purchases: This rule doesn't apply directly to this transaction since it involves a single purchase.
5. Discounts: The discount (19.49%) exceeds the stated limit of 15%, but there is a justification provided for the discount, which satisfies policy constraint 5.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7. Purchase Authorization: The department head authorization is present (Yes), so it doesn't violate this rule since the transaction amount is above AED 5,000.
8. Duplicate Invoices: We don't have information on duplicate invoices for this specific transaction to assess compliance with this policy constraint.
9. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount is less than AED 10,000, so there was no need for prior finance department approval.

Therefore, the answer is 'No', the transaction does not violate any of the stated policy constraints under the given information."
T316,19-07-24,13267.7,Vendor F,PO1120,Purchase,12.71%,,Yes,19-08-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions) because the purchase was made from a vendor (Vendor F) that is not pre-approved by the procurement department. The approved vendors are listed as Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, and Vendor I in the provided policy."
T317,07-09-24,10746.25,Vendor G,PO1167,Purchase,7.63%,,No,17-09-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. It violates the Maximum Purchase Limit rule (point 1 in the policy). The purchase amount of AED 10746.25 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Furthermore, according to the given data, there is no record of 'Prior_Finance_Approval: Yes' for this transaction."
T318,01-07-24,3361.23,Vendor G,PO1007,Invoice,1.24%,,No,18-07-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction details, this transaction does not violate any policy constraints. Here is a summary of the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 3361.23 which is less than AED 10,000, so it does not require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date for this invoice (18-07-24) is within the allowed 30 days of the purchase date (01-07-24), meeting the policy requirement.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction vendor, Vendor G, is included in the list of procurement approved vendors.
4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about previous transactions within a 7-day period to compare against this transaction, so it cannot be determined if it violates the multiple purchases constraint.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage provided (1.24%) is less than 15%, which means no justification for the discount is required according to the policy.
6. Tax Compliance: Since the tax paid field is marked as 'No', it's possible that this transaction might violate the tax compliance constraint, but more information about the vendor and the nature of the purchase would be needed to confirm this.
7. Purchase Authorization: The department head authorization (Yes) is provided for this transaction since the amount is more than AED 5,000.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no indication that a duplicate invoice exists for this purchase order, so it doesn't seem to violate this policy constraint."
T319,07-10-24,3441.81,Vendor C,PO1797,Purchase,20.54%,,Yes,31-10-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the discount percentage. According to the policy (point 5), invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification for the discount. In this case, there's no justification provided for the 20.54% discount. Therefore, the transaction does not comply with the stated policy requirement."
T320,19-08-24,14794.66,Vendor B,PO1979,Purchase,0.33%,,Yes,06-09-24,No,Consulting Services,No,No violation
T321,10-08-24,13821.09,Vendor I,PO1268,Invoice,2.20%,,Yes,03-09-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts). The discount provided in this transaction is 2.20%, which is more than 15% of the original price if we assume that 2.20% is greater than 15% of AED 13821.09. However, there is no justification for the discount mentioned in the 'Discount_Justification' field as per policy requirement. Therefore, the transaction violates this policy constraint even though it has prior department approval and finance approval for the amount exceeding AED 10,000."
T322,08-08-24,6615.73,Vendor D,PO1891,Invoice,1.39%,,Yes,10-08-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T322 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of the comparison:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 6615.73) is below the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission deadline for this transaction (submitted on 10-08-24 and purchase date on 08-08-24) is within the 30 days allowed in the policy.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, 'Vendor D', is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). However, since there is no specific mention of vendor restrictions regarding transactions below the single transaction limit of AED 10,000, it does not violate this policy.
4. Multiple Purchases: The multiple purchase restriction within a 7-day period and total amount do not apply to this single transaction.
5. Discounts: The discount on this invoice (1.39%) is below the threshold of 15% that requires justification, so it does not violate this policy.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment as stated in the 'Tax Paid' field (Yes).
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (AED 6615.73) is below the authorization limit of AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There is no indication of duplicate invoices for this transaction.

In summary, none of the policy constraints appear to be violated in this transaction. However, it would still be beneficial to ensure that Vendor D is added to the procurement approved vendors list if they regularly provide goods or services within the limits specified by the organization's policy."
T323,06-10-24,12194.85,Vendor A,PO1253,Purchase,4.32%,,No,12-10-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1. The amount of the purchase (AED 12,194.85) exceeds the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department, which is AED 10,000 as stated in the Purchase Policy Document."
T324,21-07-24,9742.71,Vendor H,PO1654,Purchase,19.70%,Special promotion applied,No,04-08-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in the ""Discounts"" section of the Purchase Policy Document (Policy point 5). The discount percentage for this transaction (19.70%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% of the original price without a justification from the vendor and internal approval."
T325,23-08-24,8508.75,Vendor D,PO1156,Purchase,3.40%,,No,05-09-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to Vendor Restrictions (Policy 3). The transaction was made with Vendor D, which is not on the list of procurement approved vendors. According to the provided policy, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department."
T326,01-07-24,4745.43,Vendor C,PO1446,Purchase,10.44%,,No,04-07-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The transaction amount of AED 4745.43 is not within the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department as stated in policy point 1: ""Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department."" Additionally, the Department_Authorization field shows that the amount is less than AED 5,000, but purchases of any amount require authorization from the department head if they are above AED 5,000 as stated in policy point 7: ""Purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head."" Therefore, even though this transaction is not technically violating the AED 5,000 authorization requirement due to an error in the data, it still falls short of compliance with the AED 10,000 maximum purchase limit without prior approval."
T327,12-09-24,5244.72,Vendor B,PO1051,Invoice,14.59%,,No,07-10-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions (policy 3): The transaction was made with a vendor (Vendor B) that is not pre-approved by the procurement department. Only vendors A, C, E, G, and I are approved.

2. Discounts (policy 5): The invoice has a discount of 14.59%, which exceeds the allowed 15% without providing justification. The Discount_Justification field is left empty.

Even though the purchase amount is below AED 10,000 and there was no prior finance approval required for this transaction, these two violations still exist. It's important to adhere to all policy constraints, not just those related to transaction amounts or approvals."
T328,10-07-24,10177.6,Vendor D,PO1742,Invoice,18.74%,Special promotion applied,No,20-07-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit). The transaction amount of AED 10,177.6 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it does not have the 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field marked as 'Yes', which is required for transactions over AED 10,000."

T330,17-10-24,2231.31,Vendor E,PO1882,Purchase,7.67%,,Yes,05-11-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Based on the given policy and transaction data, the transaction T330 does not appear to violate any of the provided policy constraints. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 2231.31, which is less than AED 10,000 and doesn't require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (05-11-24) is within the allowed timeframe of 30 days after purchase date (17-10-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor E is a procurement approved vendor, so it's not a violation of this policy.
4. Multiple Purchases: This transaction does not involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so it doesn't violate that policy either.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (7.67%) is below the threshold of 15%, so no justification is required.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment details (Tax Paid: Yes), which aligns with the policy constraint.
7. Purchase Authorization: Since the amount does not exceed AED 5,000, department authorization is not necessary.
8. Duplicate Invoices: This transaction doesn't have any information about duplicate invoices, but there's no indication that this is a violation based on the provided data.

In summary, T330 does not appear to violate any of the listed policy constraints in the given scenario. However, it's essential to consider other potential policies or guidelines that may not be included in the provided document for a comprehensive assessment."

T332,10-09-24,7891.65,Vendor D,PO1320,Purchase,15.08%,Special promotion applied,No,20-09-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Discounts policy (policy point 5). In this case, the discount percentage (15.08%) is above the allowed limit of 15% and no justification from the vendor or internal approval has been provided in the Discount_Justification field. Therefore, the transaction does not comply with the specified policy."

T334,05-10-24,11806.92,Vendor H,PO1873,Purchase,24.49%,,No,23-10-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) and number 7 (Purchase Authorization). The reason being that the discount percentage of 24.49% exceeds the approved limit of 15%, but there is no justification provided for this discount in the Discount_Justification field as required by the policy. Additionally, the transaction amount of AED 11806.92 exceeds the approval limit of AED 5,000 without authorization from the department head, as indicated by Department_Authorization: Yes."
T335,15-10-24,3236.99,Vendor E,PO1794,Purchase,16.57%,Special promotion applied,No,29-10-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the specific violations:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage (16.57%) is above the allowed threshold of 15%. Therefore, there should be a justification for this discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, which is missing in this transaction.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as stated in the policy. Specifically, it shows ""No"" for the 'Tax Paid' field. This violates the tax compliance policy."
T336,01-07-24,12998.18,Vendor E,PO1410,Purchase,18.99%,Special promotion applied,No,16-07-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount (AED 12,998.18) exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval).

2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The field shows 'No', indicating that there was no prior finance department approval for this transaction, which is required since the amount is more than AED 10,000 (Purchases above AED 10,000 require prior approval from the finance department).

3. Discounts: The discount on the invoice (18.99%) is above the allowed limit of 15% without proper justification. Even though a justification was provided, it needs to be submitted within the transactions.csv file in the 'Discount_Justification' field, which seems to be missing in this case.

It is important to note that while this transaction violates multiple policies, resolving these issues might involve addressing multiple departments (procurement, finance, and IT). Therefore, it would be necessary to communicate with all relevant parties to ensure compliance and avoid future violations."
T337,27-08-24,13973.19,Vendor G,PO1461,Purchase,21.02%,Special promotion applied,No,04-09-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T337 does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to the Maximum Purchase Limit (point 1). The transaction amount of AED 13,973.19 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department as stated in the policy. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'."
T338,04-08-24,6360.05,Vendor D,PO1871,Invoice,9.43%,,No,18-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions).

The transaction has a discount of 12.74%, which is above the permitted 15% threshold mentioned in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for this discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, which is another violation of the policy."
T340,07-07-24,12953.18,Vendor B,PO1788,Purchase,4.14%,,Yes,27-07-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) as the amount of AED 12953.18 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, since no prior Finance department approval was provided in this case, it also violates constraint number 7 (Purchase Authorization)."

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 10596.52 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage (16.92%) on this invoice is more than the allowed threshold of 15%. Additionally, the justification for the discount was not included in the transaction data, which is also a policy violation."

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 6,306.85, which is less than AED 10,000. It doesn't require prior finance approval since it's below the limit.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (04-08-24) falls within the 30 days from the purchase date (07-07-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor E is in the list of procurement approved vendors.
4. Multiple Purchases: There's no mention of multiple purchases involving this transaction, so it can't be compared against the AED 20,000 limit within a 7-day period.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (4.82%) is below the allowed 15% threshold without requiring justification. There's no 'Discount_Justification' field filled in this transaction.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment, as indicated by ""Yes"" under Tax Paid.
7. Purchase Authorization: The department head authorization is provided, since the amount (AED 6,306.85) is more than AED 5,000.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about whether this transaction has a duplicate invoice or not.

Therefore, based on the given policy constraints and provided transaction data, it seems that transaction T343 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints."
T344,11-10-24,11378.19,Vendor H,PO1700,Invoice,9.04%,,Yes,20-10-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T344 does violate a policy constraint. The violation is under the Maximum Purchase Limit rule, specifically the ""Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department."" The amount of this transaction (AED 11,378.19) exceeds the limit of AED 10,000. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'. It violates the policy because the transaction amount is greater than the allowed limit and does not have prior finance department approval."
T345,13-07-24,14179.07,Vendor D,PO1003,Purchase,14.70%,,No,17-08-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.
2. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is more than AED 5,000 and there is no department head authorization.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor D) is not on the list of procurement approved vendors."
T346,06-10-24,4610.12,Vendor G,PO1432,Purchase,7.29%,,Yes,11-10-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T346 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints.

Here are the reasons for this conclusion:
1. Maximum Purchase Limit (Single Transaction): The transaction amount is AED 4,610.12 which is less than AED 10,000 and doesn't require prior finance department approval.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: Although the submitted date is later than 30 days from the purchase date (assuming 06-10-24 was the purchase date), the policy states that any invoices submitted later will be flagged for review, not automatically considered a violation of the policy.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction is with vendor G, which is one of the procurement approved vendors (Vendor G is listed in the Procurement Approved Vendors section).
4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction doesn't involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so it doesn't fall under this policy constraint.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage of 7.29% is less than the threshold of 15%. Although no justification for the discount is provided in the transaction data, it does not lead to a violation as long as the vendor provides an internal approval and the discount meets the specified criteria.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments (Tax Paid: Yes) which complies with the stated policy.
7. Purchase Authorization: The amount of the transaction is less than AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: Since no duplicate invoice information was provided, it's impossible to determine if this policy constraint has been violated.

In summary, transaction T346 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints given in the provided information. However, it is essential to verify if there are other policies or contextual factors that may affect the compliance status of the transaction."

T349,16-08-24,8814.89,Vendor G,PO1691,Purchase,4.91%,,Yes,02-09-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint 1 - Maximum Purchase Limit. The transaction amount of AED 8,814.89 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it is important to note that according to policy constraint 7 - Purchase Authorization, purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head, and in this case, Department_Authorization is listed as 'No'."
T350,19-07-24,11797.15,Vendor D,PO1192,Invoice,1.46%,,Yes,19-07-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The policy states that purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (Purchase Limit, Point 1). The transaction amount of 11797.15 AED is above the limit of 10,000 AED and does not have Prior_Finance_Approval in the provided data."
T351,26-07-24,9954.2,Vendor E,PO1726,Invoice,7.07%,,Yes,31-07-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 as the purchase amount of AED 9954.2 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. This violation occurs because the transaction did not have ""Prior_Finance_Approval: Yes""."
T352,13-09-24,11324.39,Vendor E,PO1173,Invoice,6.49%,,Yes,13-09-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T352 does not violate any of the specified policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of why:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 11,324.39) does not exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction, so prior approval from the finance department is not required.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted on the same day as the purchase date (13-09-24), which is within the allowed 30 days.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction was made with a pre-approved vendor (Vendor E).
4. Multiple Purchases: This is an individual purchase, so there's no need to consider multiple purchases within a 7-day period.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (6.49%) is below the threshold of 15%. Therefore, no justification is required from the vendor or internal approval.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes.""
7. Purchase Authorization: The amount does not exceed AED 5,000, so no department head authorization is required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices have been mentioned in the provided data.

In summary, transaction T352 complies with all of the specified policy constraints."
T353,31-07-24,14771.68,Vendor F,PO1118,Invoice,3.59%,,No,19-08-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount of the transaction (AED 14,771.68) exceeds the single transaction limit without prior approval from the finance department (AED 10,000).

2. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is more than AED 5,000 and does not have authorization from the department head (Department_Authorization: No).

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor F) is not listed as a procurement approved vendor (not in the list: Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, Vendor I)."
T354,08-07-24,11192.94,Vendor D,PO1035,Invoice,19.46%,Special promotion applied,Yes,24-07-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor D, is not included in the list of procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I).

2. Discounts: The discount given on this transaction (19.46%) exceeds the maximum allowed without prior justification (any discount above 15% of the original price requires a justification from the vendor and internal approval). In this case, there is no mention of any such justification in the provided data."
T355,26-08-24,9642.28,Vendor D,PO1688,Invoice,15.58%,Special promotion applied,Yes,04-09-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions (3): The vendor ""Vendor D"" is not listed as a pre-approved vendor in the Procurement Approved Vendors list.
2. Discounts (5): The invoice has a discount of 15.58%, which exceeds the 15% limit set by the policy, but there is no justification provided for the discount."
T356,14-07-24,12098.94,Vendor H,PO1967,Purchase,3.47%,,Yes,11-08-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T356 does violate one policy constraint. The violation is related to the ""Vendor Restrictions"" rule (Policy 3), as Vendor H is not listed among the Procurement Approved Vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, or I). Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'. It's important to ensure that purchases are only made from pre-approved vendors to maintain policy compliance."
T357,23-09-24,7019.49,Vendor E,PO1839,Invoice,17.54%,Special promotion applied,Yes,29-09-24,Yes,Laptops,No,No violation
T358,02-08-24,10673.41,Vendor D,PO1564,Invoice,8.01%,,Yes,16-08-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. It exceeds the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department as stated in point 1 of the Purchase Policy Document. The transaction amount (AED 10673.41) is more than AED 10,000, and there's no indication that prior finance approval has been obtained."
T359,24-08-24,14260.6,Vendor I,PO1780,Invoice,9.31%,,No,22-09-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (""Maximum Purchase Limit""). The purchase amount of AED 14,260.6 exceeds the maximum limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (AED 10,000). Additionally, it does not comply with constraint number 7 (""Purchase Authorization"") since the Department_Authorization field indicates that the transaction required authorization but was not approved by the department head (AED > 5,000). Lastly, it does not comply with constraint number 6 (""Tax Compliance"") as the invoice states ""No"" for Tax Paid."
T360,27-09-24,11449.7,Vendor C,PO1463,Invoice,18.59%,Special promotion applied,Yes,20-10-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. According to the policy, purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage on this invoice (18.59%) is more than 15% of the original price, and no justification has been provided in the Discount_Justification field. As per the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since there is no justification provided for this transaction, it violates the policy on discounts."
T361,14-10-24,2464.15,Vendor G,PO1718,Purchase,18.19%,Special promotion applied,Yes,03-11-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount on this transaction is 18.19%, which exceeds the allowed 15% stated in Policy 5.
2. Prior Finance Approval: Despite the amount of the transaction being over AED 10,000, there was no prior approval from the finance department as shown by the value of 'No' for Prior_Finance_Approval field. This goes against Policy 1."
T362,09-07-24,12321.05,Vendor H,PO1862,Purchase,23.12%,Special promotion applied,No,15-07-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor H, is not on the list of procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). This violation can be found in clause 3 of the Purchase Policy Document.
2. Discounts: The discount percentage provided for this transaction (23.12%) exceeds the allowed limit of a 15% discount without proper justification. Although the transaction data field 'Discount_Justification' indicates a special promotion, no internal approval is mentioned. This violation can be found in clause 5 of the Purchase Policy Document.
3. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments, which goes against policy constraint number 6, stating that all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. Since Vendor H is not mentioned as a tax-exempt vendor, this violation can be found in clause 6 of the Purchase Policy Document.

In conclusion, the transaction violates multiple clauses in the Purchase Policy Document: Clause 3 (Vendor Restrictions), Clause 5 (Discounts), and Clause 6 (Tax Compliance)."
T363,30-09-24,3825.66,Vendor B,PO1289,Purchase,21.19%,,Yes,08-10-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The transaction from Vendor B exceeds the maximum discount allowed by the Purchase Policy. According to point 5 of the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification for the discount. In this case, no justification was provided for the 21.19% discount. Therefore, the transaction does not comply with the Discounts policy."
T364,11-10-24,3404.58,Vendor E,PO1010,Purchase,10.10%,,No,27-10-24,No,Laptops,No,No violation
T365,05-07-24,3596.67,Vendor D,PO1503,Invoice,16.98%,Special promotion applied,Yes,19-07-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy, the transaction T365 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints directly. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Point 3): The transaction is made with vendor ""Vendor D"" which is not included in the list of Procurement Approved Vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). According to the policy, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department.

2. Discounts (Point 5): The invoice has a discount of 16.98%, which is above the stated 15% limit. However, it includes a justification for the discount (""Special promotion applied""). According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since we don't have information about the internal approval process, it is not clear if this transaction violates this specific policy or not.

In summary, based on the provided information, the answer is 'Yes', as the transaction involves a vendor (Vendor D) not included in the list of Procurement Approved Vendors. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm if the discount also violates any policy constraints."
T366,11-07-24,14697.58,Vendor E,PO1137,Invoice,5.84%,,Yes,11-07-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 - Maximum Purchase Limit. The purchase amount of AED 14,697.58 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department as stated in the policy document."
T367,09-08-24,11695.05,Vendor C,PO1381,Purchase,4.38%,,Yes,13-08-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 as the amount (AED 11695.05) exceeds AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Although there is department authorization, the purchase still requires prior financial approval due to the exceeded limit."
T368,12-07-24,2345.54,Vendor C,PO1954,Invoice,16.55%,Special promotion applied,No,26-07-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5: Discounts. The invoice has a discount of 16.55%, which is above 15% of the original price. However, there is no justification for this discount provided in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to the policy, any invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, neither the justification nor the prior finance department approval is present."
T369,14-08-24,11666.1,Vendor I,PO1421,Purchase,13.73%,,No,12-09-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) as the purchase amount of AED 11,666.1 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it violates policy constraint number 7 (Purchase Authorization) as there is no Department_Authorization for a purchase over AED 5,000."
T370,10-08-24,3704.71,Vendor F,PO1796,Invoice,24.66%,Special promotion applied,Yes,10-09-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in the Discounts section of the policy. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the discount (24.66%) exceeds the permitted threshold of 15%, but there is no mention of a justification for the discount in the provided data. Therefore, this transaction does not comply with the policy requirement regarding discounts."
T371,01-08-24,11918.58,Vendor C,PO1353,Purchase,13.51%,,Yes,10-08-24,Yes,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. It exceeds the maximum purchase limit without prior approval from the finance department. The transaction amount of AED 11918.58 is more than AED 10,000, which requires prior finance approval. Additionally, it has a discount of 13.51%, but there is no justification provided for the discount in the Discount_Justification field. According to policy 5, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Therefore, this transaction violates two policies: the maximum purchase limit rule and the discount approval rule."
T372,15-08-24,3348.19,Vendor E,PO1577,Purchase,23.23%,Special promotion applied,Yes,19-08-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Based on the provided policy document, the transaction T372 does violate a policy constraint. The reason is that the discount percentage of 23.23% exceeds the maximum allowed discount of 15%. According to policy point 5, any invoice with discounts above 15% requires a justification from the vendor and internal approval, which seems not to be present in this transaction as per the data provided. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'. However, it's important to note that this assessment does not consider other factors such as tax compliance or procurement from pre-approved vendors, which could also lead to a violation if those aspects of the policy are not met."
T373,21-08-24,6365.54,Vendor A,PO1812,Purchase,20.99%,Special promotion applied,No,14-09-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage in this transaction (20.99%) is more than 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the high discount. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, since the 'Discount_Justification' field contains a justification, it indicates that the policy was indeed violated because there is no internal approval mentioned.

2. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction does not have prior finance department approval, even though the amount exceeds AED 10,000. According to the policy, purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. In this case, since 'Prior_Finance_Approval' is marked as 'No', it shows that the policy was violated."
T374,06-08-24,3829.37,Vendor A,PO1128,Purchase,0.09%,,Yes,25-08-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction details, the transaction with Transaction ID T374 does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are the reasons for this assessment:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 3829.37) is below AED 10,000, so no prior approval from the finance department is needed.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (25-08-24) is within the 30 days of the purchase date (06-08-24), so it meets this constraint.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor A, is included in the list of procurement approved vendors.

4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so this policy cannot be assessed from the provided data.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (0.09%) is below 15%, and there's no justification for the discount in this transaction. However, as it falls under the stated limit, there is no violation of the policy.

6. Tax Compliance: The tax was paid (Yes) according to the provided data.

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount is below AED 5,000, so authorization from the department head is not required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no indication of duplicate invoices for this transaction, so it adheres to this policy.

In conclusion, the provided transaction T374 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. However, it's essential to remember that there may be additional policies or factors affecting the assessment of a transaction that were not presented in the given information."
T375,07-07-24,10697.53,Vendor E,PO1493,Purchase,0.68%,,No,23-07-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1. The transaction amount of AED 10697.53 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department, as stated in section 1 of the Purchase Policy Document."
T376,18-08-24,5782.95,Vendor D,PO1204,Purchase,23.60%,Special promotion applied,Yes,22-08-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction does appear to violate multiple policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor D is not in the list of procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). Therefore, the purchase from Vendor D violates the vendor restrictions policy.
2. Discounts: The discount percentage (23.60%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. However, there is a justification provided for the discount ('Special promotion applied'). To ensure compliance with the policy, it would be necessary to review the justification and determine if it meets the requirement for internal approval.
3. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount (5782.95) exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior finance department approval. Since there is no 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field with a value of 'Yes', this transaction also violates the policy."
T377,25-07-24,3043.15,Vendor A,PO1314,Purchase,9.50%,,No,02-08-24,No,Laptops,No,No violation
T378,23-08-24,14217.73,Vendor F,PO1712,Purchase,11.87%,,No,24-09-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount of the transaction (AED 14,217.73) exceeds the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (AED 10,000).

2. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction was made with vendor F, which is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor (Vendor A, C, E, G, or I).

In addition, there are no justifications for the discount provided in this transaction and the tax was not paid. However, these issues can be addressed separately once the primary violation of policy constraints is resolved by obtaining approval from the finance department and using a procurement-approved vendor."
T379,16-09-24,4294.41,Vendor D,PO1476,Purchase,11.68%,,Yes,05-10-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No,No violation
T380,21-07-24,2601.6,Vendor A,PO1146,Purchase,2.29%,,No,25-08-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T380 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a breakdown:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of 2601.6 AED is below the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (25-08-24) is within the 30 days allowed from the purchase date (assuming the purchase date was before 25-08-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor A is a procurement-approved vendor.
4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction does not involve multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period, so this constraint is not applicable.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (2.29%) is below the 15% threshold without requiring justification or internal approval.
6. Tax Compliance: Although tax was not paid in this transaction, it is acceptable because the vendor is tax-exempt according to the policy.
7. Purchase Authorization: The department head has authorized the purchase (Department_Authorization: Yes) as the amount is above 5,000 AED.
8. Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices have been mentioned for this transaction, so this constraint is not applicable.

Therefore, the answer is 'No', the transaction T380 does not violate any policy constraints as stated."
T381,27-07-24,7647.5,Vendor B,PO1365,Purchase,23.89%,Special promotion applied,Yes,18-08-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Discounts policy (point 5). The discount percentage given for this transaction is 23.89%, which is above 15% of the original price. According to the policy, any invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, in this case, there is no justification provided for the high discount percentage. Therefore, the transaction violates the Discounts policy."
T382,22-08-24,3772.13,Vendor H,PO1445,Purchase,8.84%,,Yes,15-09-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a brief explanation:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 3772.13, which is below the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (15-09-24) is within the 30 days deadline of the purchase date (22-08-24).

3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor H is not listed among the procurement approved vendors, but the policy does not seem to explicitly state that purchases are only allowed from pre-approved vendors for new vendors like Vendor H.

4. Multiple Purchases: There is no information about previous transactions involving the same vendor or item, so it's impossible to determine whether this transaction exceeds the total limit within a 7-day period.

5. Discounts: The discount (8.84%) is below the 15% threshold at which justification is required. There is no justification provided for the discount in this case, but since it's below the threshold, it does not violate the policy.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments (Tax Paid: Yes).

7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is less than AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no indication that this is a duplicate invoice for the same purchase order.

Overall, based on the information provided, this transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. However, it's essential to ensure that new vendors are properly vetted and approved by the procurement department according to the organization's procedures, even if they are not explicitly listed in the policy document."
T383,25-09-24,3053.16,Vendor F,PO1934,Purchase,1.40%,,Yes,25-10-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Based on the provided policy document and transaction data, the transaction T383 violates two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Policy 3): The vendor ""Vendor F"" is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor in the policy. Only transactions made from vendors who are pre-approved by the procurement department are allowed, and Vendor F does not fall under this category.

2. Purchase Authorization (Policy 7): The transaction amount of AED 3053.16 is above the AED 5,000 threshold, but there is no Department_Authorization for this transaction in the provided data. According to the policy, purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head (Department_Authorization: Yes).

So, the answer is 'Yes', and the transaction violates the Vendor Restrictions and Purchase Authorization policies."
T384,07-08-24,12369.47,Vendor C,PO1548,Invoice,1.12%,,No,08-08-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T384 does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in regard to the Maximum Purchase Limit (Policy point 1) as the transaction amount of 12369.47 AED exceeds the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department (Prior_Finance_Approval field is 'No' in this case). Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'."
T385,03-07-24,6134.86,Vendor A,PO1770,Invoice,17.56%,Special promotion applied,No,01-08-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount provided in this transaction is 17.56%, which exceeds the maximum allowable discount of 15%. As per policy point 5, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval, but there's no such justification in this case.

2. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount is AED 6,134.86, which exceeds the maximum limit for single transactions without prior approval (AED 10,000) as stated in policy point 1. However, there's no prior finance approval mentioned in this transaction (Prior_Finance_Approval field is 'No')."
T386,02-09-24,9827.41,Vendor B,PO1419,Invoice,7.25%,,Yes,22-09-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 - Vendor Restrictions. The vendor for this transaction (Vendor B) is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, Vender I). Therefore, it is not allowed to make purchases from Vendor B without prior approval from the procurement department."
T387,28-07-24,8256.08,Vendor I,PO1150,Purchase,20.03%,Special promotion applied,No,29-07-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The policy states that purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (Policy 1). In this case, the transaction amount of AED 8256.08 exceeds AED 10,000 and does not have Prior_Finance_Approval. Therefore, it violates the policy."
T388,14-09-24,3413.16,Vendor F,PO1738,Purchase,6.09%,,Yes,10-10-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Based on the provided policy, this transaction does not violate any of the listed policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount is AED 3413.16 which is less than AED 10,000, so prior approval from the finance department is not required.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission deadline is 30 days from the purchase date, and in this case, it's more than that (the transaction was on 14-09-24 and the submitted date was 10-10-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor F, is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor. However, the policy does not specify any consequences for using unapproved vendors.
4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about previous transactions within the last 7 days to compare with this transaction.
5. Discounts: The discount is 6.09%, which is less than 15% of the original price, so there's no need for justification or internal approval.
6. Tax Compliance: The tax was paid (Tax Paid: Yes).
7. Purchase Authorization: The amount is less than AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about duplicate invoices for this transaction.

However, it's important to note that the policy does require prior finance approval for purchases exceeding AED 10,000 and the vendor in question is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor. If these requirements are essential for your organization, you should consider implementing them."
T389,10-08-24,2949.63,Vendor D,PO1880,Invoice,13.36%,,Yes,13-09-24,Yes,Projector,No," Based on the given policy and transaction data, the transaction T389 does violate one policy constraint. The violation occurs under Policy 5 - Discounts, as the discount percentage (13.36%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. Even though there is no justification provided for the discount in the transaction data, a discount above the permitted threshold requires a justification and internal approval. Therefore, the answer is 'Yes'."
T390,25-08-24,4122.86,Vendor C,PO1348,Purchase,8.50%,,Yes,12-09-24,Yes,Projector,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction with Transaction ID T390 does not appear to violate any of the explicitly stated policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of the comparison:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (4122.86 AED) is less than the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: Although the submission date (12-09-24) is after the provided deadline (30 days from purchase date), the policy does not specify a maximum number of days for transactions, only invoices. Since this is a purchase transaction, it seems to be within the acceptable time frame according to the policy.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor C) is listed as one of the procurement approved vendors.

4. Multiple Purchases: This transaction does not involve multiple purchases in a 7-day period, so it's not applicable for this specific case.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (8.50%) is less than 15%, and there is no justification provided. However, as the discount falls within the policy limits, there seems to be no violation here.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments (Yes), so it's compliant with this policy requirement.

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount of the transaction (4122.86 AED) is less than 5,000 AED, and department authorization is provided (Yes).

8. Duplicate Invoices: The policy does not specify any information about duplicate purchase orders, only invoices. This transaction appears to be a single purchase with no indication of duplicates, so it's compliant with this policy requirement as well."
T391,31-07-24,5591.79,Vendor H,PO1098,Purchase,15.76%,Special promotion applied,Yes,23-08-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T391 violates two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Rule 3): The vendor ""Vendor H"" is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor (Procurement Approved Vendors are: A, C, E, G, I).

2. Discounts (Rule 5): Although the discount percentage (15.76%) is within the allowed limit (up to 15%), it should include a justification in the ""Discount_Justification"" field, which is missing in this case.

So, the answer is 'Yes' – this transaction violates policy constraints."
T392,10-10-24,7621.9,Vendor A,PO1397,Invoice,18.25%,Special promotion applied,Yes,03-11-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Discounts section (policy point 5) of the Purchase Policy Document. In this case, the discount (18.25%) exceeds the allowable limit of 15% of the original price without providing a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Therefore, the transaction violates the policy."
T393,17-10-24,12154.57,Vendor I,PO1613,Invoice,22.82%,Special promotion applied,Yes,20-11-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) and possibly number 8 (Duplicate Invoices). The transaction has a discount of 22.82%, which is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the discount in the Discount_Justification field as per policy. Also, since there's no mention of any prior transactions with the same Purchase Order ID (PO1613), it could potentially violate policy constraint number 8 if this is a duplicate invoice. However, without context or information on previous transactions related to PO1613, it is not possible to definitively say whether there's a duplicate invoice issue."
T394,27-07-24,6565.92,Vendor F,PO1945,Purchase,22.97%,Special promotion applied,Yes,22-08-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions) because the vendor ""Vendor F"" is not listed in the Procurement Approved Vendors list. According to the policy, purchases can only be made from vendors who are pre-approved by the procurement department. In this case, since ""Vendor F"" is not on the approved list, the transaction violates this policy."
T395,08-09-24,10258.64,Vendor B,PO1028,Purchase,22.18%,Special promotion applied,Yes,13-09-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (""Maximum Purchase Limit"") as the Amount (10258.64) exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department."
T396,02-07-24,12505.42,Vendor F,PO1988,Purchase,19.03%,Special promotion applied,No,01-08-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 12,505.42 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor F, is not listed as a procurement approved vendor (Vendor F is not among Vendor A, C, E, G, or I).

These two violations make the transaction non-compliant with the Purchase Policy Document."
T397,26-09-24,8292.63,Vendor C,PO1696,Invoice,11.44%,,No,11-10-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 6 (Tax Compliance) because the transaction does not include tax payments as required by the policy. Additionally, it also violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) because the discount percentage is above 15% (11.44% > 15%) and there is no justification provided for the discount in the Discount_Justification field."
T398,16-07-24,10917.77,Vendor E,PO1873,Purchase,19.34%,Special promotion applied,No,15-08-24,No,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) as the purchase amount of AED 10,917.77 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it also violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) as the discount percentage is above 15% and there is no justification mentioned in the Discount_Justification field for the large discount applied."
T399,04-08-24,11554.42,Vendor E,PO1654,Purchase,9.05%,,Yes,06-08-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (""Maximum Purchase Limit""). The purchase amount of AED 11,554.42 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department as stated in the policy. Additionally, since no Prior_Finance_Approval is mentioned for this transaction, it is not compliant with the policy."
T400,04-08-24,5934.98,Vendor F,PO1842,Purchase,12.59%,,No,02-09-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates a policy constraint. The transaction with ID T400 is from an unapproved vendor (Vendor F), which is against policy point 3. As Vendor F is not listed in the Procurement Approved Vendors list, purchases cannot be made from this vendor without prior approval from the procurement department."
T401,04-08-24,11867.52,Vendor I,PO1986,Purchase,23.29%,Special promotion applied,Yes,26-08-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in regard to the ""Discounts"" section of the Purchase Policy Document (policy point 5). The discount on this transaction exceeds the allowed limit of 15% as it has a discount of 23.29%. However, since there is a justification provided for the discount (""Special promotion applied""), this might need further review and approval to ensure it meets the organization's guidelines for exceptions to the policy. Nonetheless, the initial transaction still violates the stated policy unless an exception has been explicitly approved."
T402,05-07-24,7224.02,Vendor B,PO1323,Purchase,9.45%,,No,10-07-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor B) is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I).
2. Prior Finance Approval: The amount of the transaction (7224.02 AED) exceeds AED 10,000, and prior approval from the finance department is required for such transactions. In this case, there was no prior finance approval (Prior_Finance_Approval: No).
3. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as it is marked as ""No"" under Tax Paid. According to policy, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt."
T403,07-10-24,10321.48,Vendor C,PO1435,Invoice,5.98%,,No,29-10-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Based on the provided policy document and transaction data, the following transaction violates two policy constraints:

1) Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (10321.48 AED) exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. According to the policy, purchases cannot exceed this limit without prior approval.

2) Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction does not have prior approval from the finance department even though it exceeds the limit of AED 10,000. As per the policy, all transactions above AED 10,000 require prior finance department approval.

Therefore, the answer is 'Yes', the transaction violates the stated policy constraints."

1. Discounts: The invoice has a discount of 23.60%, which is above the 15% threshold specified in the policy. According to the policy (point 5), invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, no such justification is provided in this transaction.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments, which goes against point 6 of the policy that states all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. In this case, there is no indication that the vendor is tax-exempt."
T406,09-10-24,8753.55,Vendor I,PO1120,Purchase,0.58%,,Yes,01-11-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the given transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here's a breakdown of the transaction against each policy constraint:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 8,753.55, which is less than AED 10,000, so no prior approval from finance is required.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date of the transaction (01-11-24) is within the 30 days of the purchase date (09-10-24), which means the invoice was submitted on time.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor for this transaction, Vendor I, is listed among the procurement approved vendors.
4. Multiple Purchases: Since there's no information about previous transactions within a 7-day period, it's impossible to determine if this transaction violates the multiple purchases policy.
5. Discounts: The discount for this transaction is 0.58%, which is less than 15% of the original price. No justification was provided for the discount, but since it's below the threshold, no additional action is required.
6. Tax Compliance: The tax was paid (Yes) according to the provided data.
7. Purchase Authorization: The amount of this transaction (AED 8,753.55) is less than AED 5,000, so it does not require authorization from the department head.
8. Duplicate Invoices: Since there's no information about duplicate invoices for this transaction, it's impossible to determine if this policy has been violated.

In conclusion, based on the available information, this transaction does not seem to violate any of the stated policy constraints."
T407,31-08-24,7130.04,Vendor G,PO1225,Purchase,11.77%,,No,28-09-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 6 (Tax Compliance) because it states that all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. In this case, the transaction has ""Tax Paid: No"", indicating that no taxes were paid, which goes against this policy."
T408,11-07-24,2721.6,Vendor H,PO1315,Invoice,5.80%,,No,27-07-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is with respect to Vendor Restrictions (Policy point 3). The transaction was made with Vendor H, who is not listed as a Procurement Approved Vendor in the given list of vendors. According to the policy, purchases can only be made from pre-approved vendors by the procurement department."

The vendor, Vendor F, is not listed as a procurement approved vendor (as per the given list: Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, Vendor I), which makes it invalid according to the policy. Additionally, the discount percentage of 21.43% exceeds the 15% limit set in the policy, and there is no justification provided for the high discount, as required by policy constraint number 5."
T411,10-09-24,11747.87,Vendor E,PO1369,Purchase,9.30%,,Yes,03-10-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 as the purchase amount of AED 11,747.87 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it violates policy constraint number 7 since no authorization was provided for the department head if the amount is more than AED 5,000, but in this case, it exceeds that limit as well (AED 11,747.87 > AED 5,000)."

T413,03-07-24,6344.3,Vendor D,PO1255,Purchase,9.70%,,No,04-08-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Based on the provided policy document and transaction data, the transaction T413 does not appear to violate any of the specified policy constraints. Here is a breakdown of the compliance check for this transaction:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 6344.3) does not exceed AED 10,000. Although it requires department authorization, it doesn't need finance approval since the amount is below the threshold of AED 10,000.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The transaction was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (04-08-24 minus 30 days equals 03-07-24), so it complies with this policy constraint.
3. Vendor Restrictions: Transaction vendor, Vendor D, is not in the list of procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). However, the policy doesn't specify any penalty for purchasing from unapproved vendors; it only states that such purchases require pre-approval. In this case, we don't have information about whether Vendor D was pre-approved or not.
4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction is a single purchase, so it complies with the multiple purchases policy constraint.
5. Discounts: The discount (9.70%) is below 15% of the original price, so no justification is required in this case.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as stated, but it's also noted that vendors who are tax-exempt can omit tax details. It's not clear from the provided information whether Vendor D is tax-exempt or not.
7. Purchase Authorization: Department authorization (Yes) has been provided for this transaction, and the amount is below AED 5,000, so it complies with the purchase authorization policy constraint.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information indicating that this transaction includes a duplicate invoice.

In summary, based on the available information, the transaction T413 does not appear to violate any of the specified policy constraints, but it may have issues with vendor restrictions and tax compliance depending on whether Vendor D is pre-approved and/or tax-exempt."

T415,03-09-24,9410.23,Vendor A,PO1435,Purchase,16.18%,Special promotion applied,Yes,08-10-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts). The policy states that invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, the transaction has a discount of 16.18%, which exceeds the allowed limit of 15%, but there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field. Therefore, the transaction violates the policy."
T416,08-08-24,10895.74,Vendor F,PO1535,Invoice,10.78%,,Yes,26-08-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 as the purchase amount (AED 10,895.74) exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it seems that there is no Prior_Finance_Approval and Department_Authorization for this transaction which are required when the amount is more than AED 10,000 and AED 5,000 respectively."
T417,01-09-24,4888.88,Vendor E,PO1274,Purchase,14.90%,,No,09-09-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to the Discounts policy (point 5). The transaction has a discount of 14.90%, which exceeds the 15% threshold specified in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for this discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. This violates the requirement that invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval."

T419,17-07-24,11010.66,Vendor E,PO1140,Purchase,21.39%,Special promotion applied,No,30-07-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted later than 30 days after the purchase date (30-07-24 is more than 30 days from 17-07-24).

3. Discounts: The discount given in this transaction is 21.39%, which is above the allowed 15% without proper justification. Although a justification is provided, it should be noted that internal approval is also required for invoices with discounts above 15%.

4. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount of AED 11,010.66 exceeds the threshold of AED 5,000, and there is no department head authorization provided in the transaction data.

To be compliant with the policy, the following actions should be taken for this transaction:

- Obtain prior finance department approval for purchases exceeding AED 10,000.
- Submit invoices within 30 days of the purchase date.
- If the discount is above 15%, a justification from the vendor and internal approval should be obtained.
- Ensure proper authorization from the department head for transactions exceeding AED 5,000."
T420,14-08-24,5951.87,Vendor A,PO1089,Invoice,18.82%,Special promotion applied,Yes,14-08-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The policy states in point 5 that ""Invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval."" In this case, the invoice has a discount of 18.82%, which is above the permitted 15%. However, there is no mention of an internal approval for this transaction, which means it does not comply with the policy requirement. Additionally, while the vendor (Vendor A) is pre-approved, it's important to note that all purchases must still follow the other policies, such as the discount limit and internal approval when necessary."
T421,27-07-24,11994.63,Vendor C,PO1838,Purchase,15.91%,Special promotion applied,Yes,15-08-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) because the amount of the purchase exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. The transaction is for AED 11,994.63, which is beyond the allowed limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction. Additionally, the transaction does not have a 'Prior_Finance_Approval' value of 'Yes', indicating that there was no prior approval from the finance department despite exceeding the maximum purchase limit."
T422,26-09-24,11080.21,Vendor A,PO1396,Invoice,2.79%,,Yes,05-10-24,No,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint 1. Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. The transaction amount (AED 11,080.21) exceeds this limit. Additionally, it does not have 'Prior_Finance_Approval' in the transactions.csv file, which is required when the amount exceeds AED 10,000."
T423,15-07-24,7177.91,Vendor A,PO1735,Invoice,23.77%,Special promotion applied,No,17-07-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount on this invoice is 23.77%, which exceeds the 15% limit set by the policy without a justification provided. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, no justification was provided.

2. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount is AED 7177.91 which is greater than AED 10,000, the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. However, the 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field shows 'No', indicating that there was no prior finance approval given.

To be compliant with the policy, the transaction should either have a justification for the high discount or receive prior finance approval. Additionally, if the vendor is not pre-approved by the procurement department, it would also be a violation of the policy. In this case, since Vendor A is in the list of Procurement Approved Vendors, it does not violate that particular policy constraint."
T424,17-08-24,12314.22,Vendor I,PO1742,Purchase,17.66%,Special promotion applied,No,31-08-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints.

1) Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 12,314.22 exceeds the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department, which is AED 10,000.

2) Discounts: The discount percentage (17.66%) on this transaction is above the threshold of 15%. However, there is no justification provided in the 'Discount_Justification' field, which is a violation of policy #5.

The other policies seem to be met as the vendor (Vendor I) is among the procurement-approved vendors, the invoice was submitted within 30 days (though close to the deadline), and no duplicate invoices were indicated in the provided data. The transaction amount is less than AED 5,000, so department authorization is not required, and there are no specific requirements for tax compliance in this case as the vendor is not tax-exempt. Multiple purchases are also not relevant given that this is a single transaction."
T425,05-07-24,8390.26,Vendor I,PO1831,Invoice,17.56%,Special promotion applied,Yes,07-07-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount percentage (17.56%) is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field. As per the Purchase Policy Document (point 5), invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval.
2. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount (8390.26 AED) exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department (point 1). Since the Prior_Finance_Approval field indicates 'No', this policy is violated.

In summary, the transaction violates the policy due to the lack of justification for the discount and because it exceeds the maximum purchase limit without prior finance approval."
T426,12-08-24,6889.34,Vendor D,PO1156,Invoice,9.58%,,Yes,28-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction with Transaction ID T426 does not violate any policy constraints in the given policy document directly. Here is a breakdown of the comparison:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit - The purchase amount of AED 6889.34 is below AED 10,000, so it doesn't require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline - The invoice was submitted within 30 days (28-08-24, which is less than 30 days after the transaction date 12-08-24), so it complies with this policy.
3. Vendor Restrictions - Vendor D is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor in the given list of vendors, but since the policy does not specify any consequences for using non-approved vendors for invoices (only purchases), this transaction may still comply with the policy. However, it's important to note that the use of non-approved vendors should be addressed and clarified to ensure compliance in future transactions.
4. Multiple Purchases - The transaction does not involve multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period, so this constraint is not relevant for this case.
5. Discounts - The discount percentage of 9.58% is less than 15%, so no justification or internal approval is required.
6. Tax Compliance - The transaction includes tax payments (Tax Paid: Yes), so it complies with this policy.
7. Purchase Authorization - The transaction amount is below AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices - No duplicate invoices are mentioned for this transaction, so this constraint is not relevant in this case.

However, as mentioned earlier, using a non-approved vendor (Vendor D) should be addressed and clarified to ensure compliance in future transactions. It's essential to maintain accurate vendor records and update the policy accordingly if necessary."
T427,08-09-24,13594.07,Vendor A,PO1215,Invoice,2.62%,,Yes,16-09-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Based on the provided policy, the transaction T427 does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to the ""Maximum Purchase Limit"" (Policy 1). The amount of this transaction (13,594.07 AED) exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department, as stated in policy point 1. Therefore, 'Yes', this transaction does violate a policy constraint."
T428,08-10-24,11875.15,Vendor G,PO1495,Invoice,22.31%,Special promotion applied,No,13-10-24,Yes,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit (Section 1): The transaction amount is AED 11,875.15 which exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (Prior_Finance_Approval is 'No').

2. Discounts (Section 5): The invoice has a discount of 22.31% which is above the 15% limit stated in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for this high discount (Discount_Justification field is not empty but the explanation provided, ""Special promotion applied,"" does not seem to justify a discount above 15%).

Additionally, it's worth noting that:

- The transaction was submitted late as the Submitted Date is more than 30 days after the Purchase Date (Section 2) and will be flagged for review.
- Tax Compliance (Section 6): Since the field 'Tax Paid' shows 'No', the transaction may be flagged due to missing tax details."
T429,16-09-24,8427.51,Vendor B,PO1287,Purchase,10.66%,,Yes,19-09-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint 3 (Vendor Restrictions) as Vendor B is not listed in the Procurement Approved Vendors list. Additionally, it also violates policy constraint 5 (Discounts) since the discount percentage is above 15% and there is no justification provided for the discount."
T430,01-07-24,4841.08,Vendor G,PO1466,Purchase,19.78%,Special promotion applied,No,25-07-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Discounts: The discount given in this transaction (19.78%) is above 15% of the original price (as per policy 5). Therefore, it should include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, there's no such justification provided in this case.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as stated in policy 6. Transactions missing tax details will be flagged, which is the case here.

3. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 (as per policy 1), but there's no prior approval from the finance department (Prior_Finance_Approval field shows 'No'). This also violates the policy."
T431,08-08-24,11458.93,Vendor B,PO1415,Invoice,7.21%,,Yes,27-08-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 - Maximum Purchase Limit. The transaction amount of 11458.93 AED exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it seems that there is no Prior_Finance_Approval field indicating that the purchase was approved by the finance department, which is also a requirement for transactions above 10,000 AED."
T432,31-08-24,8302.53,Vendor I,PO1815,Invoice,3.77%,,Yes,10-09-24,Yes,Projector,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction T432 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here's an explanation for each relevant constraint:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount (8302.53 AED) is below the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (10-09-24) falls within the 30 days window after the purchase date (31-08-24).

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor I) is pre-approved by the procurement department, as it is listed among the Procurement Approved Vendors.

4. Multiple Purchases: There's no relevant information in this transaction regarding multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so we cannot determine if there is a violation of this constraint.

5. Discounts: The discount (3.77%) is below the threshold of 15% of the original price, so a justification from the vendor and internal approval are not required.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments (Tax Paid: Yes).

7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (8302.53 AED) is below the authorization limit of 5,000 AED, and there's a department head authorization (Yes).

8. Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices are mentioned for this transaction.

Therefore, the answer is 'No', as the transaction does not violate any policy constraints as given in the description."
T433,13-09-24,10787.7,Vendor C,PO1376,Invoice,20.50%,,No,12-10-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount (AED 10787.7) exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. According to the policy, prior finance approval is required for transactions above AED 10,000. In this case, it is not indicated that there was prior finance approval (Prior_Finance_Approval: No).

2. Discounts: The discount percentage (20.5%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15%. However, there is no justification provided for the discount (Discount_Justification: ). According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

These two violations are significant enough that they warrant further investigation and potential action to ensure compliance with the established purchase policy."
T434,26-08-24,9909.79,Vendor E,PO1127,Purchase,14.62%,,No,17-09-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 9909.79 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (Purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval).

2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction does not have prior finance department approval, even though it exceeds the limit of AED 10,000 (Purchases above AED 10,000 require prior approval from the finance department)."

The maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department is AED 10,000 according to policy 1 of the Purchase Policy Document. However, the transaction amount in this case exceeds that limit (AED 11,688.2)."
T437,10-09-24,7798.68,Vendor I,PO1971,Purchase,13.61%,,Yes,04-10-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount on this transaction (13.61%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% without justification as the Discount_Justification field is empty. This violates the policy stated in point 5 of the Purchase Policy Document.

2. Prior Finance Approval: The transaction amount of AED 7,798.68 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department as indicated by the empty 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field. This violates the policy stated in point 1 of the Purchase Policy Document."
T438,27-08-24,13845.16,Vendor E,PO1806,Invoice,8.45%,,No,26-09-24,Yes,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit). The purchase amount of 13845.16 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, there is no indication that prior finance approval has been given, which is required in this case."
T439,14-10-24,4240.27,Vendor F,PO1541,Purchase,21.31%,,Yes,15-11-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Policy 3): The vendor for this transaction, Vendor F, is not on the list of procurement-approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). According to the policy, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department.

2. Discounts (Policy 5): The discount for this transaction is 21.31%, which exceeds the permitted limit of 15% without a justification. The field 'Discount_Justification' is empty, meaning there is no justification provided for the high discount. As per the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

It would be beneficial to remind the responsible party to ensure that all transactions comply with these policies in the future."
T440,04-07-24,4204.69,Vendor C,PO1046,Invoice,7.80%,,Yes,17-07-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Based on the given policy document, the transaction T440 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here is a summary of why:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 4204.69) is less than AED 10,000, which is the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (04-07-24, submission date: 17-07-24), so it meets this policy constraint.

3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor C is a procurement approved vendor (Vendor C is included in the list of Procurement Approved Vendors).

4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction does not represent multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period, so it meets this policy constraint.

5. Discounts: The discount (7.80%) is below 15% of the original price, so no justification or internal approval is needed in this case according to the policy document.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments (Tax Paid: Yes) as required by the policy.

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount of AED 4204.69 is less than AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not needed according to this policy constraint.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There is no information suggesting that the same purchase order (PO1046) was invoiced multiple times. Therefore, it does not seem to violate the duplicate invoice policy."
T441,26-07-24,10480.56,Vendor H,PO1805,Invoice,21.69%,,No,23-08-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in the Maximum Purchase Limit rule (1). The transaction amount of AED 10480.56 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, there is no prior finance approval provided for this transaction."
T442,09-09-24,13990.47,Vendor H,PO1706,Purchase,14.31%,,No,24-09-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount is more than AED 5,000 and there is no department authorization.

3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor H is not listed as a procurement approved vendor.

4. Discounts: The discount percentage on the invoice (14.31%) is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for the discount.

These violations make the transaction non-compliant with the Purchase Policy Document."
T443,20-09-24,10518.48,Vendor B,PO1883,Purchase,14.96%,,Yes,19-10-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 as it exceeds AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, since there is no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, it might also be in violation of policy constraint number 5 if the vendor-provided discount exceeds 15% of the original price."
T444,19-08-24,14672.91,Vendor D,PO1119,Invoice,18.67%,Special promotion applied,No,27-08-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. The policy states that purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction without such approval.

2. Discounts: The discount on this invoice is above 15% of the original price and no justification has been provided in the Discount_Justification field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor for this transaction (Vendor D) is not listed as one of the procurement approved vendors. According to the policy, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department."
T445,03-08-24,4826.64,Vendor E,PO1601,Purchase,24.85%,Special promotion applied,No,15-08-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount (24.85%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% of the original price without proper justification. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval, but in this case, no such justification is provided.

2. Prior Finance Approval: Even though the transaction amount (4826.64 AED) does not exceed AED 5,000, which would require department head authorization, it requires finance department approval because the purchase amount (4826.64 AED) is greater than AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department as stated in the policy."
T446,03-09-24,2139.26,Vendor D,PO1628,Invoice,2.08%,,No,04-09-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions). The vendor for this transaction, Vendor D, is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor (Vendor A, C, E, G, I are the approved vendors). Therefore, purchases cannot be made from unapproved vendors. This violation of the policy can have consequences such as disapproval of the purchase and potential financial implications."
T447,24-07-24,11409.52,Vendor D,PO1185,Purchase,1.50%,,No,05-08-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints because it exceeds the Maximum Purchase Limit stated in point 1 of the policy. The transaction amount (AED 11409.52) is more than AED 10,000 for a single transaction and doesn't have prior approval from the finance department as indicated by 'Prior_Finance_Approval: No'."
T448,13-08-24,5765.76,Vendor F,PO1284,Purchase,21.34%,,Yes,13-08-24,Yes,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction appears to violate two policy constraints:

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor F) is not listed among the Procurement Approved Vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I).
2. Discounts: The discount percentage (21.34%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% without a justification provided in the 'Discount_Justification' field.

It is recommended to contact the vendor and provide a justification for the high discount or check if Vendor F has been recently approved by the procurement department. Additionally, it may be necessary to request internal approval to justify the large discount or the use of an unapproved vendor."
T449,06-09-24,10147.07,Vendor E,PO1907,Purchase,1.72%,,Yes,20-09-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is related to the Maximum Purchase Limit as per policy 1. The transaction amount exceeds AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Although the vendor, Vendor E, is pre-approved by the procurement department, the transaction value itself goes beyond the allowed limit."
T450,09-09-24,2029.5,Vendor F,PO1678,Invoice,13.63%,,Yes,22-09-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraint regarding discounts. According to the Purchase Policy Document, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. However, in this case, there is no justification for the 13.63% discount provided by Vendor F on transaction T450."
T451,01-10-24,14982.48,Vendor I,PO1818,Invoice,19.78%,Special promotion applied,Yes,03-10-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) because the discount percentage (19.78%) is above 15% of the original price, but there is no justification provided for this high discount in the Discount_Justification field. According to the policy document, all invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, there is no justification provided."
T452,11-10-24,11000.16,Vendor D,PO1548,Invoice,13.21%,,Yes,02-11-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (""Maximum Purchase Limit"") as the amount (AED 11,001.16) exceeds the allowed limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, the transaction does not comply with policy constraint number 5 (""Discounts"") because an invoice with a discount above 15% (the discount is 13.21%, which is greater than 15%) does not include a justification from the vendor and internal approval."
T453,21-09-24,13590.43,Vendor D,PO1895,Purchase,23.86%,Special promotion applied,No,25-09-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of 13590.43 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage (23.86%) on this invoice is above the allowed limit of 15%. However, there is a justification provided for the discount (Special promotion applied). According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% need both a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, since there is no internal approval mentioned, it violates the policy.

3. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount of 13590.43 exceeds the AED 5,000 threshold that requires authorization from the department head. However, Department_Authorization field shows 'No'.

4. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor D) is not listed as a procurement approved vendor (only Vendor A, C, E, G, and I are). Therefore, this purchase violates the policy."
T454,13-07-24,12107.77,Vendor C,PO1294,Purchase,20.78%,,No,30-07-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount of the transaction is 12,107.77 AED which exceeds the single transaction limit of 10,000 AED without prior approval from the finance department (as per policy point 1).

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted later than 30 days after the purchase date (as per policy point 2). Although this specific field in the transaction data does not mention it's an invoice, the date of submission being more than 30 days after the purchase date indicates a violation.

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor used for this transaction, Vendor C, is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (as per policy point 3).

4. Discounts: The discount provided in this transaction exceeds the 15% threshold without including a justification from the vendor and internal approval (as per policy point 5). Although the Discount_Justification field is empty, this can be assumed as it does not have any justification provided.

5. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments, which is against the policy (as per policy point 6)."
T455,10-08-24,10236.54,Vendor D,PO1972,Purchase,15.61%,Special promotion applied,Yes,27-08-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit). The purchase amount of AED 10236.54 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department as stated in the policy. Additionally, the transaction requires Department_Authorization as it is over AED 5,000 but it has been marked as 'No'. This transaction also violates this condition."
T456,08-08-24,8093.93,Vendor B,PO1102,Invoice,20.63%,,No,11-08-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions). The transaction was made with Vendor B, which is not listed as a procurement approved vendor (Vendor A, C, E, G, I are the only approved vendors per the provided list). Therefore, it does not comply with the purchase policy."
T457,28-09-24,8567.03,Vendor B,PO1270,Purchase,23.40%,Special promotion applied,Yes,28-09-24,No,Laptops,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount on this transaction (23.40%) exceeds the 15% limit set in the Purchase Policy Document. According to rule 5, any invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price require a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, since there is no mention of a justification for the high discount, it violates the policy.

2. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction was made with Vendor B, which is not on the list of Procurement Approved Vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). According to rule 3, purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department. In this case, since Vendor B is not approved, it violates the policy."
T458,24-09-24,8044.43,Vendor F,PO1364,Invoice,13.50%,,No,11-10-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints.

1. Vendor Restrictions (Policy 3): The vendor for this transaction, Vendor F, is not among the procurement-approved vendors listed in your policy document (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). Therefore, the purchase from Vendor F violates the vendor restrictions outlined in the policy.

2. Discounts (Policy 5): The discount percentage for this transaction (13.50%) is above the allowed threshold of 15%. However, no justification for the discount has been provided in the transaction data (Discount_Justification field is empty). As per the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, neither the vendor nor the internal department has provided a justification for the 13.50% discount."
T459,04-09-24,3473.15,Vendor H,PO1677,Purchase,2.28%,,Yes,21-09-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, the transaction with Transaction ID T459 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are some points that support this:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 3473.15, which is below AED 10,000 and thus does not require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission date (Submitted Date) is within 30 days of the purchase date, meeting the policy requirement.
3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction vendor, Vendor H, is not listed among the procurement-approved vendors. However, since it's a purchase transaction and not an invoice, this policy constraint might not apply directly to this case.
4. Multiple Purchases: This transaction does not fall under the multiple purchases rule as there is no information about previous transactions within a 7-day period involving the same item or vendor.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (2.28%) is less than 15% of the original price, so an explicit justification for the discount is not required according to the policy.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes.""
7. Purchase Authorization: The department head authorization (Department_Authorization) is present and indicates that the amount exceeds AED 5,000, which is another policy requirement met in this case.
8. Duplicate Invoices: This transaction is a purchase, not an invoice, so it does not have an invoice counterpart to be flagged for duplicate invoices."

Here is a breakdown of the comparison:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount of 8135.45 is less than AED 10,000 and there is no prior finance approval required for this amount according to the policy document.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days (as it was submitted on 29-08-24, which is less than 30 days from the transaction date of 05-08-24)
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor I is a procurement-approved vendor.
4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction does not involve multiple purchases of the same item within a 7-day period, so this constraint is not applicable.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (9.72%) is less than 15% of the original amount, so no justification is required according to the policy document.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment (Tax Paid: Yes) as per the policy constraint.
7. Purchase Authorization: The amount of the transaction is less than AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required according to the policy document.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There is no information suggesting that this invoice is a duplicate of any previous purchase order (Prior_Finance_Approval: No and Department_Authorization: No)

In summary, the transaction T461 does not violate any of the stated policy constraints according to the provided data."
T462,04-07-24,14145.85,Vendor B,PO1411,Invoice,21.03%,,Yes,15-07-24,Yes,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) and number 5 (Discounts). The transaction amount of AED 14,145.85 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department, as stated in policy 1. Additionally, the discount percentage is more than 15% (21.03%) and does not include any justification, which violates policy constraint number 5."

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 9169.2, which is less than the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (21-09-24 vs 08-09-24).

3. Vendor Restrictions: The transaction was made with a pre-approved vendor, Vendor G, which is included in the procurement approved vendors list.

4. Multiple Purchases: Since this is an individual transaction and not part of multiple purchases within a 7-day period, it does not violate this policy constraint.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage provided (0.06%) is less than 15% of the original price. Therefore, there is no need for justification or internal approval.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment details and has been marked as ""Yes"" in the ""Tax Paid"" field.

7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (AED 9169.2) is less than AED 5,000, so it does not require authorization from the department head.

8. Duplicate Invoices: There is no information suggesting that this invoice is a duplicate of another invoice for the same purchase order.

T468,03-09-24,2720.12,Vendor D,PO1436,Purchase,23.17%,Special promotion applied,Yes,02-10-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions (Policy 3) - The vendor, Vendor D, is not listed as a procurement-approved vendor in the provided list (Procurement Approved Vendors).
2. Discounts (Policy 5) - The discount percentage (23.17%) exceeds the permitted limit of 15%. However, the transaction includes a justification for the discount, which is a special promotion applied. Nevertheless, since no internal approval is mentioned, this violates the policy.

Regarding the other policies, it appears that the transaction does not violate them, but it's important to note that:
- The amount of the transaction (AED 2720.12) is below the Purchase Authorization limit (AED 5,000), so no department head authorization is required.
- The invoice submission deadline (Policy 2) has not yet passed (Submitted Date: 02-10-24, Invoice Submission Deadline: within 30 days of the purchase date). It's hard to determine if it will be flagged for review based on this information alone.
- The transaction amount is below the Maximum Purchase Limit (AED 10,000) without prior approval from the finance department (Policy 1), but prior_finance_approval is 'No'. So, even though it's not violating the limit in this specific transaction, future transactions with Vendor D might require financial approval.
- There's no information about multiple purchases within a 7-day period or tax compliance (Policies 4 and 6) in this transaction. It's essential to check for these policy constraints when analyzing future transactions with the same vendor."
T469,11-07-24,13968.02,Vendor E,PO1573,Purchase,20.47%,,Yes,25-07-24,Yes,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 and 7.

1. The transaction amount of AED 13,968.02 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department, as stated in the policy document under point 1.

2. Even though the invoice was submitted within 30 days (as per point 2), it does not have the prior approval from the finance department if the amount is more than AED 10,000, which is required according to point 7 of the policy document."
T470,12-09-24,3978.02,Vendor H,PO1309,Purchase,10.03%,,Yes,16-10-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction does not violate any of the stated policy constraints as follows:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 3978.02) is less than AED 10,000, so no prior approval from the finance department is needed.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice submission deadline was within 30 days of the purchase date, as the submitted date (16-10-24) is more than 30 days after the transaction date (12-09-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: Vendor H is not listed among the procurement approved vendors. However, this transaction is a purchase and not an invoice, so it doesn't violate the vendor restrictions policy.
4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction is a single purchase and there are no other transactions within a 7-day period, so this policy isn't applicable.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (10.03%) is less than 15%, so no justification or internal approval is needed.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7. Purchase Authorization: The amount (AED 3978.02) is less than AED 5,000, so no department head authorization is required.
8. Duplicate Invoices: This transaction is a purchase, not an invoice. There's no duplicate invoice for the same purchase order in this case."

T472,05-08-24,12084.4,Vendor I,PO1705,Invoice,13.06%,,No,04-09-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 12,084.4 exceeds the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (as stated in point 1 of the purchase policy).

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments (Tax Paid is No), which violates point 6 of the purchase policy stating that all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt."
T473,13-10-24,2818.28,Vendor F,PO1168,Purchase,18.62%,Special promotion applied,No,22-10-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5: Discounts. The invoice with a discount of 18.62% exceeds the limit of 15% as stated in the policy. However, it is important to note that the justification for the discount was provided (Special promotion applied). In cases where justifications are required, compliance can be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and might not always result in a violation if there is an acceptable explanation. It's still recommended to bring this to the attention of the finance department for further review."
T474,17-08-24,11952.88,Vendor G,PO1888,Purchase,2.00%,,Yes,15-09-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraints because it exceeds the maximum purchase limit without prior approval from the finance department (10,000 AED). The amount of the transaction is 11952.88 AED, which is greater than the allowed limit of 10,000 AED mentioned in section 1 of the policy. Additionally, there's no prior_finance_approval field showing approval for this purchase exceeding the set limit."

T476,31-07-24,14720.07,Vendor B,PO1199,Invoice,14.49%,,No,28-08-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) and number 7 (Purchase Authorization). The amount of the transaction (14,720.07 AED) exceeds the single transaction limit without prior approval from the finance department (AED 10,000), as stated in policy point 1. Additionally, the transaction requires authorization from the department head for purchases above AED 5,000, but Department_Authorization is marked as ""Yes"" which indicates that the amount exceeds AED 5,000 and should have had department head authorization. However, it seems that there is no prior finance approval (Prior_Finance_Approval is marked as ""No"") for transactions above AED 10,000, which also violates policy point 1."
T477,25-09-24,5085.36,Vendor H,PO1276,Purchase,21.99%,Special promotion applied,Yes,06-10-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates Policy Constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions) and Policy Constraint number 5 (Discounts). The transaction was made with Vendor H, which is not a Procurement Approved Vendor according to the policy, and the discount provided by Vendor H exceeds 15% of the original price without any justification. The vendor should have been pre-approved by the procurement department, and any invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval."
T478,06-08-24,6676.12,Vendor D,PO1781,Purchase,11.48%,,Yes,07-08-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction appears to violate policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions) as Vendor D is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I). This means that purchases cannot be made from vendors who are not pre-approved by the procurement department. It's important to note that compliance with all other policies should also be ensured for a complete review of this transaction."
T479,17-07-24,9999.9,Vendor D,PO1251,Purchase,6.20%,,Yes,09-08-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1. The transaction amount is AED 9999.9 which exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department as stated in the Purchase Policy Document (point 1)."
T480,13-08-24,11701.47,Vendor A,PO1923,Invoice,4.38%,,No,17-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1, as the amount of the transaction (11701.47 AED) exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, there is no record of prior finance approval (Prior_Finance_Approval: No), which is required for transactions over AED 10,000."
T481,21-08-24,10438,Vendor E,PO1478,Invoice,24.30%,,Yes,11-09-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount of AED 10438 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.

2. Discounts: The discount percentage of 24.30% is more than the allowed 15%. However, there's no justification provided for this significant discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field, which is against policy."
T482,13-10-24,3968.77,Vendor B,PO1251,Purchase,8.96%,,Yes,18-10-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," The transaction does not appear to violate any of the policy constraints stated in the provided Purchase Policy Document, given that it adheres to the following points:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is within AED 10,000 for a single transaction.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (18-10-24 is within 30 days from 13-10-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor B) is not listed among the procurement approved vendors, but this transaction does not violate the policy since it only mentions that purchases cannot be made from vendors who are NOT pre-approved by the procurement department. In this case, we don't have information about whether Vendor B is pre-approved or not.
4. Multiple Purchases: This transaction does not involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so it complies with this policy.
5. Discounts: The discount percentage (8.96%) is below the threshold of 15%. No justification is required in this case.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment details, and the tax was paid (Yes).
7. Purchase Authorization: The department head authorized the purchase as Department_Authorization field shows 'Yes'.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no indication of duplicate invoices for this transaction.

However, it is important to note that there might be other policies or considerations not included in the provided document that could affect compliance. For instance, if Vendor B is not pre-approved by the procurement department, then it would violate the policy mentioned under point 3 (Vendor Restrictions). Also, if multiple purchases from the same vendor within a certain period exceed AED 20,000, that could potentially violate the Multiple Purchases policy. Nonetheless, based on the provided information, the transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints."
T483,10-07-24,10149.79,Vendor H,PO1665,Purchase,21.84%,,No,06-08-24,No,Office Computers,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 (Maximum Purchase Limit) as the purchase amount of AED 10,149.79 exceeds the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, it also seems to violate policy constraint number 5 (Discounts) as the discount percentage is above 15% and there is no justification provided in the Discount_Justification field. Lastly, since Vendor H is not listed among the procurement approved vendors (Vendor A, C, E, G, I), it also seems to violate policy constraint number 3 (Vendor Restrictions)."
T484,05-10-24,9052.49,Vendor G,PO1245,Invoice,18.46%,Special promotion applied,Yes,22-10-24,No,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 5 - Discounts. The transaction has a discount of 18.46%, which is above the 15% limit stated in the policy. However, there is no justification provided for this discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to the policy, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval. Since the justification is missing in this case, it violates the policy."

T486,02-08-24,14727.46,Vendor F,PO1093,Invoice,6.70%,,Yes,27-08-24,Yes,Projector,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 - Maximum Purchase Limit. The transaction amount of AED 14,727.46 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department as stated in the policy. Additionally, since there is no 'Prior_Finance_Approval' field indicating approval for this high value purchase, it also violates the requirement for approval for purchases above AED 10,000."
T487,06-09-24,5659.11,Vendor D,PO1995,Purchase,0.24%,,Yes,10-09-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction does not appear to violate any of the listed policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (5659.11 AED) is well below the single transaction limit (AED 10,000). No prior approval from the finance department was required as it's within the limit.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (10-09-24 is within 30 days after 06-09-24).

3. Vendor Restrictions: Since Vendor D is not listed as a procurement approved vendor, this transaction would violate the policy; however, in this case, we don't have that information available.

4. Multiple Purchases: The transaction is an individual purchase and does not fall under multiple purchases within a 7-day period.

5. Discounts: The discount percentage (0.24%) is less than the threshold of 15%. No justification for the discount is required.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payments as indicated by ""Yes"" in the 'Tax Paid' field.

7. Purchase Authorization: The amount does not exceed AED 5,000, so no department head authorization was required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: Since this is a new transaction with an unused 'Prior_Finance_Approval', it's not possible to determine if there are duplicate invoices for the same purchase order.

The only potential policy constraint that could be violated here is Vendor Restrictions, but we don't have enough information about approved vendors to confirm this."
T488,25-09-24,10901.02,Vendor D,PO1330,Invoice,20.78%,,Yes,27-10-24,Yes,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. The violation is in relation to the Maximum Purchase Limit rule (Policy point 1). The transaction amount of AED 10901.02 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Even though department authorization was provided, it doesn't override this specific policy constraint. It is crucial to follow both the departmental and financial approval processes when making purchases that exceed certain thresholds."
T489,29-09-24,14859.89,Vendor B,PO1409,Invoice,8.57%,,Yes,12-10-24,No,Security System Installation,No," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1 as the purchase amount of AED 14,859.89 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. Additionally, since it is an Invoice, there should be a deadline for its submission (policy constraint number 2), but the submitted date provided (12-10-24) is not within the given range to confirm if this policy has been followed or not. Lastly, since Vendor B is not listed as a procurement approved vendor (Procurement Approved Vendors: Vendor A, Vendor C, Vendor E, Vendor G, Vendor I), this transaction also violates policy constraint number 3."
T490,06-08-24,3552.94,Vendor G,PO1401,Purchase,14.50%,,Yes,27-08-24,Yes,Office Computers,No," Based on the given policy and transaction data, the following transaction does not violate any of the stated policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (3552.94 AED) is below AED 10,000 for a single transaction.

2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The submitted date (27-08-24) is within the allowed 30 days from the purchase date (06-08-24).

3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor (Vendor G) is a procurement-approved vendor.

4. Multiple Purchases: Multiple purchases have not been mentioned in this transaction, so it does not apply here.

5. Discounts: Although the discount percentage (14.50%) is above 15%, there is no justification provided for the discount. However, since the invoice amount is below AED 10,000 and there is no finance department approval required, this violation might be overlooked in this case.

6. Tax Compliance: The transaction includes tax payment details (Tax Paid: Yes).

7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (3552.94 AED) is below AED 5,000, so department head authorization is not required.

8. Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices have been mentioned in this transaction, so it does not apply here.

In summary, the transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policy constraints based on the information provided. However, it's important to note that some policies might be subject to interpretation or exceptions, and a more detailed review might reveal additional considerations."
T491,24-07-24,7003.33,Vendor C,PO1022,Purchase,20.24%,Special promotion applied,Yes,01-08-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Based on the provided policy and transaction data, this transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The discount (20.24%) is above 15% of the original price (the original price is not specified in the data given, but if it's 7003.33 * 15/100 = 1050.5, which is more than the transaction amount itself), and there is no justification provided for the discount in the 'Discount_Justification' field. According to policy point 5, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include a justification from the vendor and internal approval.

2. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount (7003.33) is more than AED 5,000, but there is no department head authorization provided in the 'Department_Authorization' field. According to policy point 7, purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head.

Therefore, the answer is 'Yes', this transaction violates two policy constraints."
T492,03-09-24,2183.22,Vendor I,PO1905,Invoice,9.87%,,No,22-09-24,No,Printer Supplies,No," Yes, the transaction violates Policy Constraint 7 - Purchase Authorization. The transaction amount (AED 2183.22) exceeds AED 5,000 but does not have ""Department_Authorization"" set to ""Yes"". Therefore, it should have been authorized by the department head according to the policy. Additionally, while this transaction does not violate any other policies mentioned in the provided document, there seems to be a missing field for Discount Justification. According to Policy Constraint 5 - Discounts, invoices with discounts above 15% of the original price must include justification from the vendor and internal approval. This might be an issue that needs to be addressed in future transactions."
T493,31-08-24,4448.17,Vendor C,PO1268,Purchase,20.72%,,No,14-09-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to the ""Discounts"" policy (point 5). The discount percentage in this transaction (20.72%) is above 15% of the original price. However, there is no justification provided for this discount in the ""Discount_Justification"" field, which is a requirement as stated in the policy. Therefore, the transaction should be flagged and reviewed to ensure compliance with the policy."
T494,29-08-24,6517.98,Vendor A,PO1725,Purchase,20.12%,Special promotion applied,No,06-09-24,No,IT Equipment,No," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1. Discounts: The invoice has a discount of 20.12%, which is above the maximum allowed discount of 15%. According to the policy (point 5), any invoices with discounts above 15% require a justification from the vendor and internal approval. In this case, there's no evidence of such justification or internal approval in the provided transaction data.

2. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments as it has 'No' under the 'Tax Paid' field. However, the policy (point 6) states that all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. There's no information indicating whether Vendor A is a tax-exempt vendor in this transaction. Therefore, based on the available data, the transaction violates the Tax Compliance policy constraint."
T495,21-08-24,9548.84,Vendor A,PO1540,Invoice,8.68%,,No,22-08-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No,No violation
T496,17-07-24,3295.02,Vendor B,PO1102,Invoice,17.25%,Special promotion applied,No,14-08-24,Yes,Consulting Services,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor B, is not included in the Procurement Approved Vendors list (Vendor A, C, E, G, I).
2. Discounts: The discount percentage on this invoice is 17.25%, which exceeds the policy's limit of 15%. However, it seems that there is a justification for the discount (Special promotion applied), but since no internal approval was provided, it violates the policy.
3. Prior_Finance_Approval: The transaction amount is less than AED 10,000, but the field 'Prior_Finance_Approval' indicates that there was no prior finance department approval. Although the purchase does not exceed the single transaction limit of AED 10,000, the policy requires approval for purchases over this amount."
T497,12-07-24,12329.1,Vendor E,PO1418,Invoice,3.54%,,No,17-07-24,No,Software Subscription,No," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to the Maximum Purchase Limit (Policy 1). The transaction amount of AED 12,329.1 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department. Since there is no Prior_Finance_Approval field indicating approval for this transaction, it violates the policy."
T498,28-09-24,6490.43,Vendor I,PO1142,Invoice,0.84%,,Yes,30-09-24,Yes,Conference Room Setup,No," Based on the given policy, the transaction does not violate any of the specified policy constraints. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit - The amount of 6490.43 is less than AED 10,000 (single transaction limit) and does not require prior approval from the finance department.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline - The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (30-09-24).
3. Vendor Restrictions - The vendor, Vendor I, is pre-approved by the procurement department as it is listed in the Procurement Approved Vendors list.
4. Multiple Purchases - This transaction does not involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so the AED 20,000 limit for multiple purchases of the same item is not applicable.
5. Discounts - The discount percentage of 0.84% is less than 15%, and no justification is required since it's below the specified threshold.
6. Tax Compliance - The transaction includes tax payments (Tax Paid: Yes).
7. Purchase Authorization - The amount of 6490.43 is less than AED 5,000, so authorization from the department head is not required.
8. Duplicate Invoices - There's no information about duplicate invoices for this transaction. However, since it appears to be a unique transaction based on the provided details, it does not seem to violate this policy constraint."
T499,14-07-24,14771.16,Vendor D,PO1260,Invoice,18.62%,Special promotion applied,Yes,26-07-24,Yes,Server Maintenance,No," Yes, the transaction violates the following policy constraints:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The amount of this transaction (AED 14,771.16) exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department.
2. Prior_Finance_Approval: The field 'Prior_Finance_Approval' indicates that no prior finance approval was given for this transaction, but it is required when the amount exceeds AED 10,000 according to the policy.

Additionally, there are other minor concerns with this transaction:

5. Discounts: The discount on this invoice (18.62%) exceeds the allowed limit of 15% without a justification from the vendor and internal approval.
4. Multiple Purchases: Given that we don't have information about previous transactions, it is impossible to verify if this transaction also violates the multiple purchases policy. However, due to the other violations, further investigation should be conducted regarding this transaction."
T500,10-07-24,13565.12,Vendor E,PO1863,Invoice,24.09%,Special promotion applied,No,10-08-24,No,Conference Room Setup,No," Yes, the transaction does violate policy constraints. Here are the reasons:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount of AED 13,565.12 exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 without prior approval from the finance department (Policy 1).

2. Discounts: The discount percentage of 24.09% is above the allowed threshold of 15%. Since there is no justification provided for this high discount in the Discount_Justification field, it also violates Policy 5.

3. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments (Tax Paid: No), but according to Policy 6, all purchases must include tax payments unless the vendor is tax-exempt. However, without information on whether Vendor E is tax-exempt or not, it's difficult to definitively say that this policy has been violated. Nonetheless, missing tax details may lead to the transaction being flagged for review (Policy 6).

4. Purchase Authorization: The Department_Authorization field indicates 'No', meaning there was no authorization from the department head because the amount exceeds AED 5,000 (Policy 7).

In summary, this transaction violates policies regarding Maximum Purchase Limit, Discounts, and Purchase Authorization. Even though it may not be clear whether the Tax Compliance policy was violated without more information about Vendor E's tax status, the missing tax details could still result in the transaction being flagged for review."
