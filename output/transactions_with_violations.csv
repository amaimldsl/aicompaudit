T001,2024-10-01,12500,Vendor A,PO1001,Purchase,10%,Yes,2024-10-05,Yes,Office Computers," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1, ""Maximum Purchase Limit"". The amount of the transaction (AED 12,500) exceeds the single transaction limit of AED 10,000 stated in the policy without prior approval from the finance department."
T002,2024-09-28,8000,Vendor B,PO1002,Purchase,5%,Yes,2024-09-29,No,Laptops," No, the transaction does not violate any policy constraints in this case. Here's why:
1.Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount is AED 8,000, which is below the limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval.
2.Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 1 day of the purchase date, well within the 30-day deadline.
3.Vendor Restrictions: No information is provided about whether the vendor is pre-approved or not, but that doesn't seem to be an issue in this case as long as the vendor has been pre-approved at some point.
4.Multiple Purchases: This transaction does not involve multiple purchases within a 7-day period, so it doesn't apply here.
5.Discounts: The discount on the invoice is 5%, which is less than 15% of the original price, so no justification or internal approval is required.
6.Tax Compliance: Tax was paid on this transaction, as indicated by ""Tax Paid: Yes"".
7.Purchase Authorization: The amount of the transaction is below AED 5,000, so authorization from the department head is not required.
8.Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices are mentioned in this case.
Therefore, the transaction appears to comply with all the policy constraints listed."
T003,2024-09-15,9500,Vendor C,PO1003,Purchase,0%,No,2024-09-16,Yes,Projector," No, the given transaction does not violate any policy constraints as stated in the Purchase Policy Document. Here's a breakdown of the compliance checks for each constraint:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit : The transaction amount is AED 9500, which is within the limit (AED 10,000) as no prior approval is required since it is below the threshold.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline : The invoice was submitted on 2024-09-16, which is within the allowed 30 days of the purchase date (2024-09-15).
3. Vendor Restrictions : There's no information provided about whether Vendor C is pre-approved by the procurement department, but as long as they are, this constraint would not be violated.
4. Multiple Purchases : There's no information about any other purchases within a 7-day period to compare against this constraint.
5. Discounts: The invoice has a discount of 0%, which is below the threshold of 15% of the original price. No justification is required in this case.
6. Tax Compliance: The transaction does not include tax payments, and there's no information about whether the vendor is tax-exempt. However, as long as the vendor is tax-exempt or tax details are provided later, this constraint would not be violated.
7. Purchase Authorization : The transaction has authorization from the department head (Yes), which is required for purchases above AED 5,000.
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no information about any duplicate invoices for the same purchase order to compare against this constraint."
T004,2024-09-01,7000,Vendor D,PO1004,Invoice,20%,Yes,2024-10-10,No,Server Maintenance," Yes, the transaction appears to violate two policy constraints:

1. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice for this purchase was submitted later than 30 days from the purchase date (2024-09-01 to 2024-10-10 is 31 days).

2. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount of AED 7,000 exceeds the AED 5,000 threshold for purchases that require authorization from the department head (as it was not provided in this case)."
T005,2024-09-25,10500,Vendor E,PO1005,Purchase,12%,Yes,2024-09-28,Yes,Conference Room Setup," Yes, the transaction violates policy constraint number 1. The purchase amount of AED 10,500 exceeds the maximum purchase limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department, as stated in the Purchase Policy Document. Even though the transaction has authorization and the vendor is pre-approved, the amount exceeds the specified limit, making it non-compliant with the policy."
T006,2024-10-03,4500,Vendor F,PO1006,Purchase,15%,Yes,2024-10-03,No,Printer Supplies," Yes, the transaction does violate a policy constraint. The violation is in relation to the Purchase Authorization rule. The transaction (Transaction ID: T006) has an amount of 4500 which is above AED 5,000, but there is no indication that it has authorization from the department head. As per policy point 7, purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head."
T007,2024-09-05,6000,Vendor G,PO1007,Invoice,0%,No,2024-10-06,Yes,Software Subscription," No, the transaction does not appear to violate any policy constraints as outlined in your Purchase Policy Document. Here are the reasons for each point of comparison:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The transaction amount (AED 6000) is below the maximum single transaction limit of AED 10,000.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: Although invoice submission was 3 days late (on 2024-10-06 instead of within 30 days of purchase date), it falls within the exception for items flagged for review rather than being an outright violation of the policy.
3. Vendor Restrictions: It's not specified whether vendor G is pre-approved, but if they are, this condition is met.
4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about previous purchases within a 7-day period, so it's unclear whether this condition has been violated or not.
5. Discounts: The invoice does not include discounts above 15% of the original price, so this condition is met.
6. Tax Compliance: Since tax was not paid and the vendor is not specified as tax-exempt, it seems that the transaction might be flagged for review due to missing tax details.
7. Purchase Authorization: The transaction states that authorization from the department head has been obtained (Yes).
8. Duplicate Invoices: There's no indication of duplicate invoices for this purchase order, so this condition is met."
T008,2024-10-05,5500,Vendor H,PO1008,Purchase,18%,Yes,2024-10-09,No,Security System Installation," Yes, the transaction violates the policy constraints in two ways:

1. Purchase Authorization: The transaction amount of AED 5,500 exceeds the AED 5,000 limit for purchases that do not require authorization from the department head (Policy point 7). Therefore, it should have been authorized before being processed.

2. Discounts: The discount on this invoice is 18%, which is above the 15% threshold specified in Policy point 5. However, there is no justification from the vendor or internal approval mentioned for this transaction. As a result, it violates that policy as well."
T009,2024-10-10,5000,Vendor I,PO1009,Invoice,12%,Yes,2024-10-11,Yes,Consulting Services," No, the transaction does not violate any policy constraints based on the provided information. Here is a breakdown of the policy points and their compliance with this transaction:

1. Maximum Purchase Limit: The purchase amount is AED 5000, which is below the maximum limit of AED 10,000 for a single transaction without prior approval.
2. Invoice Submission Deadline: The invoice was submitted within 30 days of the purchase date (2024-10-10 to 2024-10-11).
3. Vendor Restrictions: The vendor, Vendor I, is not specified as needing pre-approval, so it appears that this policy has been followed.
4. Multiple Purchases: There's no information about any previous purchases within the last 7 days to compare with this transaction.
5. Discounts: The discount of 12% is below the threshold of 15%. No further justification is needed.
6. Tax Compliance: The invoice includes tax payments, so this policy has been followed.
7. Purchase Authorization: The purchase amount is above AED 5,000 and authorization is indicated as 'Yes', so it appears that the required approval was obtained.
8. Duplicate Invoices: No duplicate invoices are mentioned for this transaction."
T010,2024-09-22,3000,Vendor C,PO1010,Purchase,0%,No,2024-10-05,Yes,IT Equipment,No violation
T011,2024-09-23,5500,Vendor C,PO1010,Purchase,0%,Yes,2024-10-05,Yes,IT Equipment,No violation
T012,2024-08-15,7000,Vendor D,PO1004,Invoice,20%,Yes,2024-10-10,No,Server Maintenance," Yes, the transaction violates two policy constraints:

1.Purchase Limit for a Single Transaction: The purchase amount (AED 7000) exceeds the maximum purchase limit for a single transaction without prior approval from the finance department. According to the policy, purchases cannot exceed AED 10,000 for a single transaction.

2.Purchase Authorization: The transaction does not have authorization from the department head as it is above AED 5,000. According to the policy, purchases above AED 5,000 require authorization from the department head.

Additionally, the discount (20%) might also be an issue if there's no justification from the vendor and internal approval as per the policy (point 5). However, without more information about the specific details of this exception, it can't be definitively confirmed whether this violates the policy or not."
